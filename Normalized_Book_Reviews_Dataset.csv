Perrott avid reader,philadelphia pa. United States,I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug self-serving and self-indulgent written by a person with little or no empathy especially for the people he castigates. For example his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the shrink bashers of the world. This play for effect tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me,1.0,6.0,Augusten Burroughs,like use amazon reviews when purchasing books especially alert dissenting perceptions about higly rated items which usually disuades selection so offer review seriously questions popularity work found smug selfserving selfindulgent written person little or no empathy especially people castigates example his portrayal family therapist seems implausible reaches effect panders shrink bashers world play effect tone throughout book very distasteful

4,0142004030:a_disappointing_mess:a._ross,142004030,Lost in a Good Book (Thursday Next Novels): Books: Jasper Fforde,books,2,A Disappointing Mess,May 17 2006,A. Ross,Washington DC,I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration maybe it doesnt matter since clearly anything can and will happen in this series and Fforde isnt all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway. The setting is the same as the first book an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of The Eyre Affair Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes such as first-edition forgeries valuable manuscript thefts and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better) when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poes The Raven and it seems they want him back. This a potentially interesting plot but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a lost Shakespeare play which looks to be the most important literary event of the century if Thursday can authenticate it. Theres also the small matter of Thursdays pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursdays role as a SpecOps Litratech and that whole milieu shes thrown into an entirely new one as a member of Jurisfiction a kind of police comprised of book ,6.0,7.0,Jasper Fforde,picked up first book series eyre affair based purely premise left somewhat underwhelmed still potential series seemed so large went ahead read second one too only even less enchanted franchise pure sequel any newcomers advised read misadventures thursday next strict order lest one miss out allusions past events although further consideration maybe doesnt matter since clearly anything can happen series fforde isnt all interested keeping linear plotline anyway setting same first book alternate mid1980s england which literature preeminent social preoccupation fresh off events eyre affair thursday next police officer specializing literature related crimes such firstedition forgeries valuable manuscript thefts like gritting her teeth through new round fame woman who saved jane eyre changed ending better when all she wants do cuddle up home her new husband landen unfortunately evil goliath corporation managed use corrupt member chronogaurd timestream police delete landen timeline holding his existence hostage first book thursday imprisoned one top men inside poes raven seems want him back potentially interesting plot keeps get lost amidst all other things fforde throws into mix most notable series strange coincidences which keep coming close killing thursday also linked events first book another plotline concerns discovery lost shakespeare play which looks most important literary event century if thursday can authenticate theres also small matter thursdays pregnancy just when one comfortable thursdays role specops litratech whole milieu shes thrown into entirely new one member jurisfiction kind police comprised book

China is portrayed as a country filled with desperate people lacking any morality with widespread corruption and widespread incompetence.

It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage revenge self pity or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination there are a few characters to chose from. The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far so I will finish the series.

12,0679750541:a_book_intended_to_deflect_attention_from_arab_racism:adel_makhoul,679750541,Culture and Imperialism: Books: Edward W. Said,books,1,A book intended to deflect attention from Arab racism,May 1 2005,Adel Makhoul,Beirut Lebanon,This book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger imperial powers.  Said condemns intellectuals in the West who in his eyes are agents of exploitation.  Yet Said himself is an agent of racism.  A Pan Arabist he always supported Arab unity and Islam at the expense of non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples.  Said directs and manipulates the Western taste for self criticim and all that does is deflect the worlds attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians Kurds Jews Israelis Coptic Christians non-Arab Sudanese etc.  Thus reading Said you would never realize that Sadam Husseins poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab intellectual or leader.  This is because a racist prevalent attitude in the Arab mind is that the entire Middle East should be Arab.  This also explains the attitude towards Israel a country that is predominantly non-Moslem and speaks a Middle Eastern language other than Arabic.The pity is that Said himself is a Christian yet he never spoke on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably other places in the Arab World.  He is facilitating the overall aim of PanArab Nationalists by distracting the West from what is happening in the Arab world.  For a better understanding of relations between the West and Islam I recommend books by Bernard Lewis such as The Moslem Discovery of Europe and the Jews of Islam.  I also recommend books by the Egyptian scholar and Jewish refugee Yael Bat Yeor such as The Dhimmi. ,19.0,71.0,Edward W.

Patten,books,2,There are better logic books out there,April 5 2005,Reviewer,which are all weirdly from Texas where the author lives,I was disappointed in this book--especially after reading the other stellar reviews (which are all weirdly from Texas where the author lives).When its a book about logic and clear thinking a reader expects that book to be free of typographical errors imprecise logic and muddled thinking.  Needless to say I almost put the book down after reading the introduction because of the missing words and typographical errors.

That is the nature of nature.  That is the reality of reality.Look at page 33.  The author states Why when one exception is uncovered multiple other exceptions surface almost right away is not entirely clear....  Probably this has something to do with the way we humans view reality.  Very disappointing--hasnt this author studied any cognitive psychology?  Its called confirmation bias and its entirely clear.One more example!  On page 60 the author states that Barbara Boxer a senator from California doesnt know the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol and is unlikely to shed intelligent light on the relative safety of either gun.  Ouch.  How does he know what Barbara Boxer knows or doesnt know?  Shes actually very well-versed on the difference between the two; has he heard her speak on the subject?

21,0471413909:closer_to_healthy_than_atkins_but_not_quite_there.:michael_salmons,471413909,The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Food You Were Designed to Eat: Books: Loren Cordain,books,2,Closer to healthy than atkins but not quite there.,August 3 2006,Michael Salmons,out in the garden shed,The Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment. It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat. Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time because their decisions are instinctual. Self-awareness creates a problem that doesnt exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans. Sometimes we do things out of curiosity or laziness or false beliefs. So considering the erratic behavior of present-day humans who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild.The fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact. Rather eat more wild-sourced food. Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem. Meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era. The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world. Now we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals. Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy. This is no longer true. The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme.

22,0393321126:biased_inaccurate_and_misleading:jill_malter,393321126,The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World: Books: Avi Shlaim,books,1,Biased inaccurate and misleading,February 13 2005,Jill Malter,jillmalter@aol.com,If you want a biased and misleading account of the Arab war against Israel this ought to satisfy you.Shlaim tells us that Jabotinsky in discussing Zionism explained that if the cause is just justice must triumph.I think Jabotinsky made a very good point here.  You see human beings will if given the chance tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.  The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.  If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it) then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.  In particular it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.Shlaim appears to have missed all this.  To him Zionism is unjust.  And to him the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.  He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state is inevitable.  I disagree.  It may be likely.  But it would serve no purpose.  It would not help Jews Arabs or others.  Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.  The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language religion culture cuisine or foreign policy.  So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.Shlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be weak demilitarized and territorially divided.  Is it just possible that this if true provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?   And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?  Or at least less desirable?  And the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make painful compromises and that Jerusalem will have to be the subject of hard bargaining. Really?Is having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?  For either side?  Of course not.  Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war poverty and destruction are somehow less painful.Had Shlaim been writing about France ,10.0,48.0,Avi Shlaim,if want biased misleading account arab war against israel ought satisfy youshlaim tells us jabotinsky discussing zionism explained if cause just justice must triumphi think jabotinsky made very good point here see human beings if given chance tend buy land places wish live ones who can make best use land wish do so high bidders land if injustice consists stealing land them justice consists letting them buy land keep which wish do if offered only low prices then easy see what triumph justice would mean here particular would mean prosperous israel triumph zionismshlaim appears have missed all him zionism unjust him triumph terror theft both forthcoming desirable tells us new independent levantine arab state inevitable disagree may likely would serve no purpose would not help jews arabs or others only purpose would damage israel people such state do not yet have independent language religion culture cuisine or foreign policy so think there still hope sanity may prevail hereshlaim also tells us new arab state weak demilitarized territorially divided just possible if true provides even more reasons why neither side might want create all could make appearance state even less inevitable or least less desirable author also explains both sides arabisraeli conflict have make painful compromises jerusalem have subject hard bargaining reallyis having peace prosperity reasonable borders painful compromise either side course not shlaim kidding us if expects us believe war poverty destruction somehow less painfulhad shlaim been writing about france

HellerRichard F. Heller,books,2,Ill Pass On Carb-Loading One Hour A Day ,May 24 2006,Livin La Vida Low-Carb Man Jimmy Moore,Spartanburg SC,When you have lost weight its a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story read my blog or book or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle one question invariably has come up from time to time: What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:Thats absolutely crazy! Theres no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method.I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. Its called The Carbohydrate Addicts Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.The CAD diet as it is referred to makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.You are NOT allowed to eat any bread fruit milk juice and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.Sound appealing anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if thats all there was to this diet then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in. ,5.0,7.0,Rachael F. HellerRichard F.

Ive seen much subtler discussions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis written for general audiences enough of them so I can recognize that Lowenstein doesnt get it; he equates efficient markets with the price that the market offers is always the intrinsic value and not with you cant reliably predict intrinsic value any better than market prices themselves do.  This is a crucial difference because it is only by assuming that market efficiency is the first that his attack holds water.The other thing that makes me very suspicious about this book is the way Lowenstein presents the character of the various people involved in the story given what his sources are.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 4 as compared to the 8 I would give Rise to Rebellion.The events recounted in Rise to Rebellion involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams Paul Revere Samuel Adams Ben Franklin and others. The Glorious Cause was not without its merits but it seemed so much drier and less appealing with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts to the point my attention wandered and getting through it was a chore in some sections unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of The Glorious Cause felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work and now that Im done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with Rise to Rebellion I dont feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didnt complement my taste as well.

They were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out I buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed. The Virgins Lover fell flat and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if its channeled from another source and times when its harder more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when Im not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced constructed.

Dubner,books,3,LIES DAMNED LIES AND STATISTICS,November 19 2006,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,a Mensa-donkey in Phoenix Airheadzona.,It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies damned lies and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner so when I ran across it at 25% off I did a stupid freakin thing and bought it.  I thought What the freak Ive got a pretty inquisitive mind and Im open to seeing things differently to discovering new viewpoints.The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time The New York Times The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is Im immediately going to be freakin suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover Prepare to be dazzled.  Well evidently Ol Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I wont even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the books dust jacket because I dont want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case a writer by his physiognomy.  So I wont mention that.)If youre the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a drivers home then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts thinking that it is cutting costs is probably increasing its overhead and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask But how? - then yes buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call common sense.  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS and AMERICAN IDOLS and LOST knuckleheads good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands that,,,Steven D.

I hated it. I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. Forget story. Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. Wells THE TIME MACHINE). The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. Its brilliantly written. In fact its so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life his loves and the region of the country he inhabits. This book has no driving plot. In fact its an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. Its not James Joyces ULYSSES nor is it trying to be but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book. Indeed that seems to be the crux. I read this book because it was by Richard Ford a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. You must read this book they said. So I did. And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. To be sure this is a judgment call but Im allowed to make it. EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. But I know Im in the minority in this. This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. But will it be so in another 25 years? Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay Modern Fiction)? Perhaps our values are changing. Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. But what it eventually evolves into is a form of ,6.0,9.0,Richard Ford,remarks site people either love novel or hate hated hated reason represents all bad about mfa program writing last 30 years emphasis entirely style forget story forget reader needs some reason reading narrative just throw out string together wonderful language reader follow anywhere some thinking goes back henry james some goes back virginia woolf who so terrified books plots or dominating conceits like hg wells time machine first 100 pages novel about real estate deal people whom frank bascombe trying sell property brilliantly written fact so brilliantly written had lot problems seeing former sportswriter being so introspective articulate about his life his loves region country inhabits book no driving plot fact arbitrarily chosen conceit what happens july 4th life one guy not james joyces ulysses nor trying every thought man book none related plot or story or any reason whatever why personany persoshould pick up book indeed seems crux read book because richard ford man whom all colleagues mainstream fiction world revere must read book said so did consider extraordinary waste time sure judgment call im allowed make every reader allowed make call know im minority book supposed one greatest american novels last 25 years so another 25 years novels now only interior monologues which virginia woolf preferred said so her essay modern fiction perhaps our values changing perhaps mfa programs country correct only cultivating style rather than story what eventually evolves into form

So imagine my surprise when after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas I read the erroneous account of the Childrens Crusade of 1212.  I had done research on this topic so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred.  Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years?  If he had he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who when told to turn back by King Philip II did so.  That ended that crusade.  The other one led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas led a group across the Alps into Italy.  Some left for home while others continued on to Rome.  Its interesting to note that in Rome many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these children were either too old or because they were pregnant.  Perhaps until relatively recently people believed in the Childrens Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles (like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred rather than relying on more contemporary sources.  Nor did they realize that the latin word pueri used in the chronicles can have several meanings (such as unmarried men rather than  children). In the final analysis you just cant rely on books like these to really teach you history.  The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it.  If only the author had bothered to check the History Channels own account of the Childrens Crusade on their website or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia.  The book gave two pages to this event and sadly got it completely wrong.For this gross oversight I am compelled to give it one star.

And then there are the infinite number of brainless Coulterisms and unsupported assertions - eg. public schools have more sex scandals per year than Catholic priests - thirty times more Liberals lie about the science on stem-cell research because they warm to the idea of destroying human embryos Ive never seen people enjoying their (9/11) husbands deaths so much.

67,0465043550:mandelbrot_repeatedly_claims_standard_models...:sigfpe_sigfpe,465043550,The Misbehavior of Markets: Books: Benoit MandelbrotRichard L. Hudson,books,2,Mandelbrot repeatedly claims standard models...,April 19 2006,sigfpe sigfpe,Oakland CA United States,...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper theyre written on Mandelbrot wouldnt have to write books like this because hed be cleaning out everyone elses wallets on the stock market. In particular if its true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is Mandelbrot doesnt know anything that countless other traders dont already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot on tour a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as my work shows that... or I demonstrated that... even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other peoples work hell do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his Everest of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesnt even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he cant be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!I think its also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book ,17.0,20.0,Benoit MandelbrotRichard L.

JenkinsFrank Muller,books,1,Can you save someones soul by insulting their intelligence?,October 22 2006,S. White Sue W,Eastern PA,To cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such it isnt even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before its too late.The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support) little in the characters actions thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis or Catherine Marshall and why arent they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.These days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was.

The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns germs (more than the other 2) and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns germs and steel.

Ryan Scott Ryan,Silver Lake OH,Ive been a fan of Heinleins SF for just about as long as Ive been an SF fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). But when I read this collection some twenty-odd years ago it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.The fiction is pretty good (although even that isnt Heinleins best). But to describe the nonfiction accurately Id have to use words that Amazon will remove from the review anyway.For the most part the pieces collected here represent a side of Heinlein I strongly dislike. Though I respect _Starship Troopers_ its never going to be my favorite Heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of fascism -- and Im not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.And mind you its not because I disagree with Heinleins opinions; its because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. Some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (At least in his fiction he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short to grok them. Not here boy.)Heinlein (who bought into the Korzybski/General Semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. But his own attempt at philosophy as represented here in e.g. The Pragmatics of Patriotism is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy Ive ever seen.Then too people who knew Heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. Well hes certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesnt agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. Even in the unlikely event that I thought he were _right_ I wouldnt find this a very helpful approach.Perhaps more surprisingly his popular writings on _science_ arent very good.

He says that we should be impeccable with our words not to take anything personally dont make assumptions and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process domestication (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however in looking further he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas but I would think most of us by a young age should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer therefore losing good standing with me as a reader.According to Ruiz as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with or become something that we are not. In essence we become a carbon copy of someone else such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states lacking statistical data to back it up that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of ,6.0,12.0,Don Miguel Ruiz,his book four agreements don miguel ruiz embodies four principles experiencing personal freedom life says should impeccable our words not take anything personally dont make assumptions always do our best basis some agreements make ourselves stem early childhood training through series rewards punishments our parents calls process domestication p 6 ruiz says 95 beliefs hold nothing lies most our agreements based upon fear rejection agreements gives meant free us emotional bonds get way our personal energy transform our liveswhile there various nuggets truth throughout book some goes off into abyss where takes thought carries what would consider illogical conclusion some instances uses biblical scripture support his claims however looking further takes some passages bible out context some his ideas presented if new ideas would think most us young age should already understanding principles although his book been highly rated hold position mr ruiz lacks credibility logic writer therefore losing good standing readeraccording ruiz children not given opportunity choose our own beliefs when go against rules punished or rewarded compliance fear rejection leads us agree or become something not essence become carbon copy someone else such our parents says our normal tendencies lost judge other people based upon agreements boldly states lacking statistical data back up 95 our beliefs based upon lie 13the implication merely nothing more than society

Although the first part of the work being a refutation of Edmund Burkes silly  nonsense is stellar and is well worth reading.  Regardless the second  part the chapter on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; in particular is composed  of the most despicable anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state  replete with progressive taxation subsidies for child birth and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus as all of these things are in his words to  be claimed as rights the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.

Bynum,Detroit MI  USA,Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the authors writing skills he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Pauls life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.  ,18.0,29.0,Paul Clemens,before purchasing made detroit read reader reviews reviews so mixed decided against buying book checked out library instead turns out made best decision all can say thank fellow reviewers book definitely not worth purchase price statement nothing do authors writing skills skilled writer everything do his lack insight paul clemens could live city have such skewed view downright scary read book waiting paul have revelation would help him put pieces his life together make peace them after 241 pages no more enlightened than page one blacks caricatures whose sole role life make pauls life hard women peripheral characters who barely given voice finds way put down demean everyone who not white male his book if white male who harbors secret racist feelings enjoy book validate feelings if anyone else reaction no doubt range mild boredom outrage read book felt sadness profound sense dismay had some worse fears confirmed there white folks who actually still think like hope light comes paul still young if does maybe share his insights us

R. Jeanclerc Reader Listener & Obsessive Observer,Brunswick OH USA,The book jacket for The Ruins offers a cant-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  Its the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.  Almost immediately youll notice that Smiths writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However despite the endless stream of words his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus there are no chapter breaks which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.  Next the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of and yet its difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what theyre doing or why they might be doing it.  Smiths attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.  And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals there is no reason why this fantastical story couldnt have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains the Saharan desert or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico archeology or mythology at all.  Ah yes the danger posed.  Well I cant say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - thats how thin the plot is.

The writer has a knack for making common words like body mind and self into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.	If you like poetry Deepak may be your read: The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)  Or try to interpret this one: The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40) 	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over intelligent design.  He cant accept the growth of any cell even a plant cell without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115 asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word quantum or not doesnt change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.

The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time had virutally no idea how he got there felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London) and so now he thought hed wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there he made a lot of money good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier and already had some idea of how things took place.

For one the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. Ive read other works from the time period shes supposed to be writing in and rather than feeling in keeping with that era this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus. Also I havent read her other book so i didnt enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (Im not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene) I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original. The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall the story being told and the Civil War aspects werent bad and could be a decent story in their own right if shed just speed things along at the beginning.However I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcotts book. In the afterward Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women even commenting how the March Family in Alcotts book isnt very interesting and how Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee. If she felt that way then why use them as the basis for her book?

McCullough,Somerville MA United States,While I found the writing style good and the information interesting the actual diet was unrealistic too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldnt stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).Im not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us while successful for varying degrees of short periods found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss some even picked up worse habits than they began with.The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan.

I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.I was disappointed by the book Photographic Composition by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:1. It does not cover all important compositional elements and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain:how elements with the similar shapes similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other the reverse perspective effect and its useswhy right and left sides of the photograph differ and why how it can be used on practicehow to balance weight of different elements of the photograph it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect exampledifference between compositional center and the center of interest how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other)all signs of perspective it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound it still should be marked in any complete work especially when the author covers other three elements)and much much more.2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic neither does it show how composition works in art which I believe is very important.3. Most examples are in color while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.4. Last but not least composition is about meaning making a message not just how to balance different elements within a frame.

Brunow ignatius_p_riley,New Orleans,This is the worst most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while their actions just become inexplicable.  The authors soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaimans darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally the characters motivations change like the shifting sands nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen Kings work (ie: The Stand) there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  Its evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly ugly ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrads intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose ,6.0,24.0,Neil Gaiman,worst most depressing piece fiction have ever read there no real protoganist not one singular character worthy admirationand after while actions just become inexplicable authors soul must truly ugly one have devoted so much time energy using his mind generate so many casual acts evil throughout book starts out promising time get about halfway through book or so get nagging sense very own soul might sucked out permanently stolen heart neil gaimans darkness or one his minions additionally characters motivations change like shifting sands nothing do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater more evil en masse like some sort coagulating bacteria or disease what so creepy about book casualness all unlike some stephen kings work ie stand there absolutely no redeeming thread hereno rallying or marshalling troops combat emerging evil evil evil vs evil surrounded evil all can say book ugly ugly ugly least writers like joyce carol oats joseph conrads intentions when writing about such things effectively demonstrate ill effects such darkness make heroes characters one should avoid unconscionable choices supposed protoganist makes make no senseand do root him very beginning find just like one them after all suspended doubt disbelief long could finally became so incensed audacity both literary critics author pass off excellence literally stopped midsentence chose

There are sentences paragraphs even pages of brilliance in this book but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers or New Mexicans or black chauffeurs or Hispanic nannies or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan I wasnt sucked along with her when she falls in love with the other Charlie.  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga she manages to develop her most sympathetic character but Sagas life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno who I loved in Three Junes lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all a very disappointing second novel.

126,1580421369:wow_what_a_disappointment!:dennis_littrell,1580421369,Doyle Brunsons Super System II: Books: Doyle Brunson,books,2,Wow what a disappointment!,March 23 2006,Dennis Littrell,SoCal,The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker! exclaims a blurb on the cover.  Well if so I can tell you that a lot of people have been or are going to be VERY disappointed.  Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is to paraphrase Mark Twain like comparing lightning to the lightning bug.This book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is A Course in Power Poker.  Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson but doesnt say anything about how to play.  Then we have Brunsons Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System.  Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled My Story.  (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunsons story get a copy of According to Doyle (1984).  It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.)Following My Story is a short history of Texas Holdem by Crandell Addington which isnt much and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker.  This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books.  However the tips are hardly exclusive for SuperSystem2 as claimed.  Beginning with Caros cute but now very familiar In the beginning everything was even money most or all of the tips have been recycled.  For example Tip #18 page 146 WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...dont bluff is just about the same as Tip #10 Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you found on page 137 in Caros Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996).  In fact Caro even recycles his exclusive tips in this very book.  Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you while Tip #40 says in part that OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away.Jennifer Harmans chapter,17.0,17.0,Doyle Brunson,most anticipated book history poker exclaims blurb cover well if so can tell lot people have been or going very disappointed comparing classic supersystem 1978 book paraphrase mark twain like comparing lightning lightning bugthis book more tribute doyle brunson than course power poker johnny chan writes fairly vacuous preface which lauds brunson doesnt say anything about how play then have brunsons introduction which tells us mostly about contributors first supersystem next there autobiographical sketch brunson entitled story if want book gives real flavor brunsons story get copy according doyle 1984 contains 47 chapters which brunson recalls his early days life roadfollowing story short history texas holdem crandell addington which isnt much then there first chapter could actually considered part course power poker would 43 tips mike caro cribbed his lectures books however tips hardly exclusive supersystem2 claimed beginning caros cute now very familiar beginning everything even money most or all tips have been recycled example tip 18 page 146 when frequent bettor checks youdont bluff just about same tip 10 seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into found page 137 caros fundamental secrets winning poker 1996 fact caro even recycles his exclusive tips very book tip 31 says players staring awayare almost always more dangerous than players staring while tip 40 says part opponents more likely bet or raise if 3 staring awayjennifer harmans chapter

Apparently someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK there were some spoilers but not more than I usually read in other reviews.

Well the last time I checked the 1st amendment still applies in this country.OK so let me try to post another review of why I didnt like this book without violating any review guidelines and Im not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end.

130,0307276902:as_authentic_as_a_daytime_soap_opera:denise_denise,307276902,A Million Little Pieces: Books: James Frey,books,1,As authentic as a daytime soap opera,October 6 2006,Denise Denise,Anacortes WA United States,Id heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought Id take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable slips and enabling and denial and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So can we look at this mans memoir and expect it to offer anything of value? Its poorly constructed repetitive and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadnt exposed him the writing takes the tone of whoppers like Freys account of the drug house visit in which he rescues Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one and I cant improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. Im not laughing.,4.0,6.0,James Frey,id heard buzz both pro con thought id take independent read dismayed book james frey insulted anyone who gone through real experience substance addiction trivializing truth whatever experience really had one hardest things addict grasp truth so can take ownership his actions take 12 steps or whatever necessary save his life often lives loved ones tangled up mess him lies what enable slips enabling denial other catch words describe continued misery failure recovery nearly impossible without honesty so can look mans memoir expect offer anything value poorly constructed repetitive narcisitic even if oprah hadnt exposed him writing takes tone whoppers like freys account drug house visit which rescues lilly other reviewers smoking gun have written about fantastic episodes one one cant improve suffice say mockery misery hope no more real than daytime soap opera story lines soap may look like real life one who isolated real life same way million little pieces might look someone who not been touched real addiction real addict typical delusion could misdirected true course treatment tragic result left impression thinks institutions people who help others substance recovery pitifully misdirected or inept like joke some kind im not laughing

It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book however plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old using words like wonderful and phrases that have been out of use since the 70s. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable,1.0,1.0,John Grisham,7 or so grisham novels ive read one least favoriteits not bad story all just way too long about 150 pages longer than needed also just lacked credibility many spots grisham normally quite good presenting characters situations least plausible if not really interesting most his books give layman some insight into workings law ive always thought fascinating book however plods along doesnt bring anything new his body workthe other thing really got dialogue wrote mark sway 11year old protagonist sounds more like streetwise 30year old using words like wonderful phrases have been out use since 70s think grisham forgot writing words young boy not one his more typically older charactersthis isnt bad book if just want escape few hours day most his other ones far more enjoyable

David Ben Moshe is  Jewish and will be killed by the English at the same time as Elisha; a Jewish man will kill an English man John Dawson.Elisha and his friends wait all night for dawn the book takes place with them in one room thinking about what they have to do they have little conversation between each other.    I did not find the book Dawn very interestingI found it to move very slow because Elisha and his friends stayed in one room during the whole story and while one man was thinking about what he should do or how he felt the reader did not know how the other people where feeling at that time.  The part I found the most interesting was when there would  be conversation between Elisha and his friends especially when they talked about their pasts which was one of my favorite parts of the book it was interesting because there was more action happening when they when explaining their past.

The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns germs (more than the other 2) and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns germs and steel.

Ive had a chance to read this book and although very good what my mother-in-law tells me is much much different. She cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition making it appear much more severe. Of course she cant write anything about this because Billys publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldnt.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist. He also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.This book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billys head.

If you are a baseball fan as I am that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint incomprehensible and really trivial. You come away thinking I really dont care bout this stuff - I dont care about the dynamics of trash about J Edgar Hoovers bathroom habits Klara Saxs artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops about characters that just dont have much depth to really care about. At the end even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.I read this book as perhaps others did expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50s (fear of nuclear weapons duck and cover classroom exercies) and a lot of knowledge about the trash business. The masterful epilogue as other reviewers call it really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillos ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing or nonchronological chapters or even random chapters but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult. Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50s-60s-70s-80s were just years of fear and the 90s are years of greed?

151,0451184963:sluggish_uneventful_corny_and_borrrrring:filmbuff-reads_stuff,451184963,Insomnia: Books: Stephen King,books,2,Sluggish Uneventful Corny and Borrrrring,October 22 2006,Filmbuff-reads stuff,Brooklyn NY,I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. Ive read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror doom and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what Insomnia is. This isnt a spoiler just the authors note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10 1990- Nov 10 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.The other King books Ive read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  Insomnias Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong kind has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesnt come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesnt usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable like Ed and Helen Deepenau the three bald doctors and Ralphs numerous confidantes.Then theres the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant) it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.  I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with so,1.0,1.0,Stephen King,usually read stephen king his interesting ideas imagery expect his books read fast well ive read three previous king books have had occasional long passages overstated depictions horror doom grotesquery order immerse his readers into tone his story one takes cake because what meant read terror horror really ridiculous unimaginative exactly what insomnia isnt spoiler just authors note end book read sep 10 1990 nov 10 1993 three years which king took write book three years which evidently wastedthe other king books ive read engrossing characterizations character identification insomnias ralph roberts certainly character reader could identify strong kind traditional gentlemanly views aiding women distress regards them beautiful respectable his counterpart lois chasse doesnt come across identifiable instead she serves secondary character who no real flair or identity other than being love ralph king doesnt usually do his secondary characters other characters much smaller roles book come across real identifiable like ed helen deepenau three bald doctors ralphs numerous confidantesthen theres whole abortion mess central political issue crumbles midway thru seems serve no purpose all story though king does provide interesting seemingly objective commentary issue via detective leydecker albeit tranparently prochoice slant serves no relevance theme story just hangs there display used no more than story device gave book two stars because am inspiring writer reading provided so

Orwell wrote the review in the Observer London April 91944.  Hayek mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book The Constitution of Liberty published in 1960 as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to The Road to Serfdom.  By 1960 when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.     While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwells works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother how many of us are aware of Hayeks infulence on him?     The Constitution of Liberty provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about liberty which requires the rule of Law to exist in todays society but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of todays inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.     ,13.0,25.0,F.

Such filth! I mean thats why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out it is tame by todays standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The books message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the mans part... Now you see what struck me about Sir Cliffords situation and Lady Chatterleys for that matter is if they really loved each other his paralysis from the waist down wouldnt have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done yes? In fact quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway.

I didnt like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I dont think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a Do Right Man at all but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book I waited for him to get a back bone which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.

Stanley,Brooklyn NY United States,I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the software that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QAd would be released in such condition.  Second of all the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware for the same amount of money ($40) allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered (using the Internet)  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books DVDs and CDs).Of course you dont have to take my recommendation to buy Readerware but please dont waste your money on Your Home Library.,14.0,14.0,Kathie Coblentz,bought off new york public library website what utter waste 40 book comes software somewhat helpful honestly there no new information anyone who been collecting books while worst part software supposed use catalog books first all difficult installthis always sign inferior product no product properly qad would released such condition second all product just fancy version spreadsheet could literally use excel or ms access catalog books just well software actually have input every piece data associated book there no excuse anyone internet connection have manually input book data state again very surprising new york public library would include product stores major major rip off there far superior cataloging products out therethe product finaly ended up using one called readerware httpwwwreaderwarecom readerware same amount money 40 allows scan barcodes booksthe software comes own cuecat scanner then software looks up barcodes entered using internet updates each barcode all available info book scanned 800 books about 45 hours btw can also use readerware scan all dvds cds have pay more get full version readware supports books dvds cdsof course dont have take recommendation buy readerware please dont waste money home library

Jance,books,1,One of the worst novels I have finished this year,October 25 2001,todd shampoe,HOUSTON TX United States,Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But by the reviews here all by women I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.

Yet I craved more details I wanted to know more about Mr. Shores childhood his parents the stims and the chaos...DETAILS!It felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is boasting of his accomplishments and how hes almost neurotypical.

Its BECAUSE HES WEIRD!  Yet the author blames his co-workers.Im sorry but the reality is the author probably cant see and understand that he IS different because he has Aspergers!

I wished he had focused in much greater detail about his feelings emotions and behaviors when he was younger-to gain a better understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now.

Cable,Madison IN,   I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection.   Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero. As the story unfolds the reason Superman quit is revealed. A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder. When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted Superman quit in disgust. The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future.   The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere. They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit destroying property and causing chaos. Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order.   When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2 it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible but with Superheroes being the catalyst. The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The worlds greatest escape artist) called the Gulag. All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman. He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DCs Angel of Death)  I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant. The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in its realism. The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.  Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag.

Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way Leadbelly didnt invent that tuning okay?,and I suspect this is what has happened to James Lee Burke.  The Dave Robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now - and that is tragic considering the promise of the early books which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead.I grew up in southern Louisiana and Burke captures a culture that many people have no experience of.  But the series is becoming repetitive and stale culminating in this book which is just awful.  Burkes characters with the exception of the always funny and touching Cletus Purcell are wearing thin and becoming less and less sympathetic.  Dave Robicheaux becomes more priceless and preachy in each novel.  His anti-alcohol tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud.Burke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again and it makes the reader wonder if he isnt cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly.

She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesnt work Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesnt work try being nice. I dont know many smokers but I dont know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face.

I love the story of Sappho what little is known of it and so I picked up this book expecting to see a historical fiction novel cut with realism research and certainly the unavoidable necessary lewdness of the celebrity of Lesbos. But monsters? Centaurs? I mean the story of Sapphos life is not the story of The Odyssey and for the life of me I dont understand why  author Erica Jong decided to give her readers a combination of Greek heroine and Clash of the Titans. Once I was able to get past the fantasy elements I realized that I was not being pulled into the story on its own merits. There wasnt enough emotional dimension -- for all her travels were shown pretty landscapes and scary oceans but we dont see enough of a real character. I read Sapphos poems in college and the talented mind behind those words is NOT present in this book. Im not saying the book is without its good points. Jong has certainly done a lot of research and her enthusiasm is many times contagious. But I found the whole bit a little odd... like picking up a book about Cleopatra and seeing her encounter dragons unicorns and the goddess Isis. If Jong had written about Ariadne this all might have worked. The blend of fantasy just didnt add up to a palatable meal for me,8.0,21.0,Erica Jong,have very mixed feelings about book cant say enjoyed all much love story sappho what little known so picked up book expecting see historical fiction novel cut realism research certainly unavoidable necessary lewdness celebrity lesbos monsters centaurs mean story sapphos life not story odyssey life dont understand why author erica jong decided give her readers combination greek heroine clash titans once able get past fantasy elements realized not being pulled into story own merits there wasnt enough emotional dimension all her travels shown pretty landscapes scary oceans dont see enough real character read sapphos poems college talented mind behind words not present book im not saying book without good points jong certainly done lot research her enthusiasm many times contagious found whole bit little odd like picking up book about cleopatra seeing her encounter dragons unicorns goddess isis if jong had written about ariadne all might have worked blend fantasy just didnt add up palatable meal

Newman Bob Newman,Marblehead Massachusetts USA,Ill put my opinion first so there wont be any doubt in your mind.  I dont believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? People are  just too different too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian if they could  write well have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one mans views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it I felt even more strongly  that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned for many years in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why  they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history socio-economic patterns religion family  etc.---but the specific results are just that specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last the tragedy of Italys long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial  scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.

A Magill,Sacramento CA USA,Like most great diplomatic moments successes and failures alike decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swishers work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable leg work to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.Mr. Swishers book follows on the heels of Dennis Rosss interesting The Missing Peace and given Mr. Rosss direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Rosss feet even when he makes claims that others at Camp David many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Rosss change of municipal Jerusalem to greater Jerusalem in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately Rosss change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.

Ive got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesnt observe personal boundaries of others what-so-ever (if I need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her stalker mom mentality. In the end I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a childs boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesnt send a message about love as much as I own you.

Sidhu,,This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And if his other works are like this it is also the last.  On the cover J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes literature read like history and history read like literature.  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to pulsating life.  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front.  I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter The Replacement is a great short story.  After reading it I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And the history reads like an 8th grade textbook. His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.  After the dislocated short story of the first chapter the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.Shaara doesnt even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918s when the Americans arrive focusing as I noted before primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here however it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.

The characters personalities were wavering in book 5 in this they completely vanished or mutated.  Ill only be getting the 7th one because its the last one and Ive read this far so I might as well go the whole way. In books one through four the trio of Harry Ron and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.As to the general plot,1.0,1.0,J.K.

231,0613215540:nothing_special_here:roger_long_longrush,613215540,For Love of the Game: Books: Michael Shaara,books,2,Nothing special here,August 25 2006,Roger Long longrush,Port Clinton OH USA,I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaaras Pulitzer Prize winning Killer Angels and because Im a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  Its a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isnt quite there.Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.

Understanding Qutbs radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan both Qutb and Strauss followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the friend and enemy model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a state of exemption.  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11 ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares or From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.

I loved Mayess previous books and was really looking forward to reading this one. The concept a year of traveling to different locations seemed like it would be really interesting combined with Mayes fresh perspectives enthusiasm for discovery feisty opinions and poetic descriptions. But somehow it didnt work. I get the sense that her heart wasnt really in this book. Maybe because the trips were taken over a span of five years and cobbled together? Or because theres so much `padding - endless quotes from her own or other peoples writing. When she liked the place her descriptions feel artificially enthusiastic almost as if the book was paid for by the chamber of commerce. I got tired of reading that she could live there or could imagine taking her grandson there or wishes she was born there or that its SO much better than San Francisco. Where she doesnt live anymore and hasnt for years. There are also too many stories about refreshing local characters who think Frances Mayes is the nicest most tasteful most interesting person theyve ever met. Especially since these people tend to be waiters cab drivers rug salesmen or others whose business depends on charming the tourists. Most of the book consists of sneering at her fellow Americans or talking about peoples personal appearance. This is boring and clich�d - and if you like that kind of thing Bill Bryson does it better. Theres also way too much name dropping (shes always mentioning my friend so-and-so the famous ____). What happened to the ordinary financially stretched middle-aged college professor?

CORNISH-BOWDEN,Marseilles France,Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins whom Rose selects as his special target illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Roses book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists opinions but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as people who either no longer do science or never did it. What a pity therefore that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book.

Newman Bob Newman,Marblehead Massachusetts USA,Ill put my opinion first so there wont be any doubt in your mind.  I dont believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? People are  just too different too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian if they could  write well have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one mans views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it I felt even more strongly  that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned for many years in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why  they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history socio-economic patterns religion family  etc.---but the specific results are just that specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last the tragedy of Italys long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial  scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.

The Canadian Eskimo Dog is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people. He has the dogs height wrong and the weight range is much too high. This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed whos to say that its not wrong on other breeds too? I was quite disgusted and mad to see the designer dogs put as purebred dogs. Labradoodles Bichon/Yorkies Cockerpoos and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs. They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money. The first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though and the pictures are nice.

Oneill,,Ive read only a few of Hillermans previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. Ive enjoyed what Ive rtead though they are an acquired taste and I dont indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his  semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee phase. From what I gather Skeleton Man continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillermans last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one I can understand that sentiment. Skeleton Man starts off with a rather risky premise tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to real life(See Nelson De Milles Night Fall) Hillerman fails here.The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters flimsy motivation and very little that could really be called action.Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story.The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillermans earlier books are for the most part glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chees wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito in the manner of far too many contrived Superman rescues Lois situations.

Unfortunately this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there of similarly detached people who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.  It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet blogs etc. offer up news without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich rich with very little effort.

However in the end the books errors just piled too high. It opens well with the story of Sonys founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II to becoming one of the worlds great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story and Morita tells it with flair.Then unfortunately the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japans seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely Japanese.Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false such as Japan supposedly having the worlds best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of second-hand goods instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the worlds worst overpackaging.)Reading between the lines a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can of course sometimes be a serious problem it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves.

His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you wont take them seriously.  But sadly he is quite  serious.  For example Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And of course who is the `rewarding life judge and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism and saying nothing new,10.0,40.0,John Kenneth Galbraith,mr galbraith smart accomplished learned man who knows what best all us his view good society differs past visions societal utopia rather than completely coercive state directing actions citizens some hirer calling mr galbraith aims practical just further defines third way nonetheless his proposal what makes good society not classical liberal view more attuned european model society many his proposals so silly wont take them seriously sadly quite serious example mr galbraith states good society everyone should have rewarding life course never defines standard which society should judge whether or not life rewarding neither does address what one should do if life unrewarding what obligation society fulfill vision rewarding life course who rewarding life judge does judge have authority state take something someone who life deemed too rewarding someone who life too unrewarding mr galbraith fails convince reader practicality his proposals ends up straddling line between socialism capitalism saying nothing new

One story after another about mazes mirrors mystical mathematical formulas and books books books. The ideas were transperant the language boring in the extreme. His poetry is trite. Who needs this?

Particularly among academics literary elites and like people many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically.

People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is. The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative. Even many of the despicable magical realist &quot;geniuses&quot; make Borges look rather plain.

Stock,Chicago IL United States,The is by far the weakest Grisham novel Ive ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense its all for naught as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.As for Joel Backman I cant think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power all the while causing numerous deaths and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?

The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time had virutally no idea how he got there felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London) and so now he thought hed wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there he made a lot of money good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier and already had some idea of how things took place.  But if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping) and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment bankers life is like (and you havent also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)) then its probably worth it.I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..,0.0,1.0,Michael Lewis,can waste time save money checking out local libraryif want get inside view inner workings wall street during excessive gyrations 80s then read den theives book well written well worth moneywhat turned off about book structure writing style first half book essentially author relating fortuitous circumstances product serendipity simply right place right time had virutally no idea how got there felt out place whole time even when raking big bucks ny london so now thought hed wwrite book about also got sense trying assuage some guilt his association salomon brothers there made lot money good him get over iti also pretty disappointed because subject matter lot more potential might have actually enjoyed had not read den theives 7 years earlier already had some idea how things took place if can get 5 or less including shipping have little no knowledge what investment bankers life like havent also seen movie wall street which covers same highlights book then probably worth iti did like wrap up did towards end book relating where had heard everyone firm ended upalthought seemed little rushed

Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning).  Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified.  Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate Pefection with Conformity and condemning it as inauthentic.  I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e. wanting to be the perfect mother perfect daughter perfect wife perfect businesswoman); therefore it creates warm fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being boring.

If this is so I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy. This is a really bad piece of sociology characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis. Why did I give it two stars instead of one then? Well it does have some OK parts. Catsells analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism. He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. This is frankly ludicrous reductionism. It doesnt even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. As Castells himself admits businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. On top of this Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations.

Soehnlein,books,1,Drama Constant Climax & Hysteria Do Not Make a Novel,June 17 2006,George Lake,New Jersey,This novel would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play often.Its not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting high drama within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.There are far too many scenes of shouting histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling Robin! I was going to scream.The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  Hes desperate for this end result of angst high drama and shock.Its overkill.  I dont believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesnt make sense that because of ONE incident all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.In short the author needs to be focused more on telling a story allowing the reader to infer.  Instead he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  Its ironic actually as hes trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.Very very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend,1.0,12.0,K. M.

RowlingJim Dale,books,1,Too popular to bother trying anymore.,November 11 2006,FantasyFan,USA,J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5 in this they completely vanished or mutated.  Ill only be getting the 7th one because its the last one and Ive read this far so I might as well go the whole way. In books one through four the trio of Harry Ron and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.As to the general plot of,1.0,1.0,J.K.

A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives tale as a piece of scientific wisdom even if it is a number. Eisenbergs number is the inverse of that draw down or twenty-five times.... well theres the rub twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants experts philosophers and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness comfort excess consumption ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.Eisenberg doesnt help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses.

Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.Even though Mario Zelda Pokemon Donkey Kong Defender Asteroids Missile Command Frogger etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the new-time classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of classics that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than iconic which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather same-y to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums such as Rez -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the ,4.0,4.0,Nic Kelman,trouble starts early there apologetic preamble which states authors would not dedicate precious space titles well known well documented beyond gaming community enormous assumption about general publics knowledge both video games moreso history design many people have heard games or seen children watch tvspinoffs most likely would not able identify what games actually looked like or anything about play dynamics gaming environmenteven though mario zelda pokemon donkey kong defender asteroids missile command frogger etc mentioned briefly there no images reference classic games us review recognize b learn if supposed sort retrospective graphic art game design not about studies techniques rendering then why not show some alltime classics well newtime classics latter better represented throughout book some choices omissions questionable brief smattering classics shown tend more humanlooking figurative than iconic which seems lacking breadth style representationbeyond much work not all feels looks rather samey lots brooding dark scenescapes characters clearly inspired countless horrorgothfantasy masters such boris vallejo or much work seen heavy metal when there mention games actually considered modern art display worldfamous museums such rez not shown any images because space taken up two nearly identical renderings lara croft same spread one ask oneself what authorpicture editor thinkingthe fact matter all longwinded talk

300,0440136482:holy_moly_:the_apostate,440136482,Holy Blood Holy Grail: Books: Michael BaigentRichard LeighHenry Lincoln,books,1,Holy Moly ,October 19 2006,The Apostate,Stockholm Sweden,This is the book Dan Browns bestseller The Da Vinci Code is based on. Indeed Michael Baigent et.al. have even sued Brown in court charging him with plagiarizing their book. The ideas behind The Da Vinci Code have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. Obviously this exposure affects Holy Blood Holy Grail as well. This book is methodologically flawed. It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. But if this happened there should be ancient documents telling us about it. There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. It simply isnt serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value as Michael Baigent does. Of course a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. But such an argument compelling as it may sound is worthless to the historian who must work with the real evidence meager as it may be. A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. Besides how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? Very few indeed. There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. Indeed the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children is good evidence against the claim. The Gnostics after all made all kinds of peculiar statements. But not this one. Why? Why are books like Holy Blood Holy Grail and The Da Vinci Code so popular? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. That in itself is somewhat damning I think.

It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. Its questionable how novel this metaphor is but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is like most sociological writing unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources many footnotes and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology this is probably a good place to start (again the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be its bane as an introduction).However the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.(The following is a charicature of the authors argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage All the world is not of course a stage but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals or groups of people and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)There are other arguments obviously and the statement we can draw a parallel with other situations is most of the content of the book which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question,6.0,20.0,Erving Goffman,revolutionary book introduces stage metaphor into sociology all social interaction performance stage questionable how novel metaphor certianly first explicit statement language used present ideas author like most sociological writing unecessarily complicated there some problems clarity structure book just doesnt have holistic feel no sociological background presupposed there extensive quoting other sociological sources many footnotes various other ways enter sociological literature throught book so if interested reading sociology probably good place start again language unecessicarily thick may bane introductionhowever book misguided idea viewing social interaction performance stage unecessary authors motives saying make position clearerthe following charicature authors argument there certianly large amount social behavior which directed towards other people audience order audience build impression actor well if can happen here can draw parallel other situations infact all situations therfore all social interaction like performance stage all world not course stage crucial ways which isnt hard specify p 72 performances can either individuals or groups people can performing conciously or unconciously end charicaturethere other arguments obviously statement can draw parallel other situations most content book which dont like gloss over sentence real question

The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge (whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).The book covers a wide variety of topics some are puzzeling. While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex-wife for being an exotic dancer. I was pretty upset to read that I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that.This book came out right after (or because of) Game of Shadows. This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information guess that backfired Pearlman. In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well.The book uses many annoymous sources (there is a reference sheet in the back most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources) so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay.The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people they like to find good stories. That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it. Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now. Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that.So once again the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground. This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires ran into the stands to attack people slept with hookers drank all the time was mean to Lou Gherig etc.While that may be,8.0,23.0,Jeff Pearlman,would love read neutral book barry bonds hate cheerleader type books about players also hate onesided ones well only good things really say about bonds about his baseball brain his relationship famous marge whom then sarcastically remarks bonds only her second favorite playerthe book covers wide variety topics some puzzeling while most book bashes barry bonds also bashes his exwife being exotic dancer pretty upset read fan pearlman thought had more class then thatthis book came out right after or because game shadows book here actually praises game shadows while bashing bonds illegal activities when 3 weeks after book came out writers book shadows being subpeoned illegally optaining information guess backfired pearlman fact game shadows may taken off shelves soon wellthe book uses many annoymous sources there reference sheet back most articles all include quotes many unidentified sources so really hard take alot harsh quotes bonds says seriously because heresaythe book pretty much discredits itself end when pearlman proclaims sports writers do not actually try or want dig up dirt people like find good stories quote alone have any bonds hater rolling thier eyes sheer stupidity sports writing became essectially tabliod now even skip bayless publically admitted most writers do thatso once again biggest problem fails stay neutral ground would like writing book about babe ruth only mentioning beat up umpires ran into stands attack people slept hookers drank all time mean lou gherig etcwhile may

As you read the book the answer comes quickly before youre even very far into the As... apparently he didnt. I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms Grimes presents.  The simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading. The introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating.  In a world no longer dominated by a few French terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old-school cooking books (say from before 1990) and the current state of culinaria.  Why then are so many of the terms defined in an out-dated even archaic mind-set? Take  the term brown sugar.  This book says it is unrefined or partially refined sugar a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago.  Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed and Grimes should know the difference.  The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein. Additionally Grimes give us  food lists scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them.  For example there is a list of Varieties of Apples.  48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking.  Sure Red Delicious apples have an insipid definition in the R section but what about the more interesting varieties like Sundowner or Lodi apples?  No further mention of them can be found in the book.

Ive read a number of James Patterson books and while Im not a hard core fan Ive enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but Im not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell. As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author readers should beware London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour). Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesnt have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller. The twists at the end - hes the wolf - no hes the wolf - no shes the wolf - no.... by the end I just didnt care. James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity not quality seems to be Pattersons priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end.,3.0,3.0,James Patterson,only explanation james paterson churned dog out make buck ive read number james patterson books while im not hard core fan ive enjoyed most them know outrage some patterson readers im not much fan alex cross who frankly find boring hell mediocre patterson often author readers should beware london bridges especially bad novel reads like abridgement moving frantic pace without ever generating any suspense premise ridiculous super criminals silly names join forces blackmail world leaders sounds like plot austin powers movie without any humour patterson not remotely qualified enter international terrorist thriller market author who churns out 3 or 4 novels year doesnt have time do kind research needed produce plausible terrorist thriller twists end hes wolf no hes wolf no shes wolf no end just didnt care james patterson written some decent crime novels his fans should beware quantity not quality seems pattersons priority days london bridges mess beginning end

That is my experience with this book. For some reason A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton a character who you barely get to know and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era maybe its past its prime maybe I dont have the required literary sensibilities or maybe I couldnt relate but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.,4.0,6.0,Charles Dickens,mark twain once said paraphrasethe definition classic something everyone wants have read no one wants read experience book some reason tale two cities never made onto any high school reading lists figured one books should have under belt so picked up what slog book might have been fascinating due french revolution subject matter mass rambling descriptions melodrama supposed shed tears sidney carton character who barely get know root lucie manettethe highly unrealistic paragon unspoiled goodness only thing liked about book how madame defarge knitted list people which she planned take revenge admittedly cool concept maybe book speaks another era maybe past prime maybe dont have required literary sensibilities or maybe couldnt relate tale two cities bored tears

Galle Duane Galle,Tweed Heads NSW Australia,While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly it is apparent that the authors own holocaust experiences (or more specifically those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get in my opinion a few pieces of interesting material. Finally the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened or would not have been so sever is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews it would not have been impossible without IBM.Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading,9.0,14.0,Edwin Black,while well researched thoughtprovoking piece literature do have some critical comments make firstly apparent authors own holocaust experiences or more specifically his family have left him vested interest how material book presented secondly there lot content trawl through get opinion few pieces interesting material finally underlying theme or accusation without ibm holocaust may not have happened or would not have been so sever again opinion flawed book shows ibm certainly made much easier nazis locate identify jews would not have been impossible without ibmhaving said all interesting read although overly wordy certainly worth reading

Butler,escondido ca United States,I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then its very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings Ive ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.Its a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.

Prechter,books,3,What Crash?,March 13 2005,B. Lovian blovian,United States,This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms bubbles and busts.Prechter should have left it at that.  Instead he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott wave counts.   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move you just dont understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  Hes imposing his theory on the market but surprisingly enough the market doesnt care.  It does whatever it wants in however many waves it wants and Bob has been very frustrated at the markets aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career but it seems hes been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the 87 crash.  Any superstitution can seem to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and youll find what youre looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts and youll find those too.  The market doesnt care about any of those things though.  Its nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave like most is no better than random stock selection. If Prechter had chosen the random method he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.

328,0786238941:one_of_koontzs_worst:jennifer,786238941,One Door Away from Heaven: Books: Dean R. Koontz,books,1,One of Koontzs Worst,November 17 2006,Jennifer,Durham NC,This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontzs recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in The Hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality) (2) devoted super-powered canine companions (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs and (4) evil bioethicists.The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter however does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils you are supposed to really really like her and fear for her safety.I dont know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics but he has a terribly misguided view of the field taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.The final issue is Koontzs near-deification of dogs particularly Golden Retrievers which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny ,,,Dean R.

In the end I felt McKnights trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.  He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.  Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well since in McKnights picture social programs and the professional service providers are in fact the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.  One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.  Mcknights views resonate with employers caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or perhaps health insurance.   What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.  It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.  In this I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.

Chandler xyzzy,Arlington Texas,Gary Zukav states in his introduction I had never studied physics. In fact I didnt like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.I noticed that some reviewers refer to the New Physics is that like New Age or voodoo physics? 90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose. Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.At least get it straight before mixing it up.

He acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody.  Instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it why doesnt he use his experience and know-it-all knowledge to offer real concrete and practical solutions?

The protagonist herself was brilliant and complex. So naturally I expected the same thing out of Swimming Sweet Arrow. Man was I disappointed. This was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic womans masochistic sex life pathetic obsession with brutal men and pathetic quest for attention. Her entire life is a meta-existence: rather than desiring she desires to be desired. Rather than enjoying she enjoys being enjoyed. The male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who didnt exhibit the most common stereotypes; in her world all men are sensation-craving brutes and all women are attention-craving doormats. The men want drugs fun and sex and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing--not the drugs not the sex just being a victim due to the attention it provides.

Ive read most of this book. Im still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter. Ill start with what I liked. Harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship (or courtship if you get caught up in semantics) However Harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly. I think this is good wisdom but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship. He talks very little about communication skills. Also you wont find much on personality traits or compatibility.  When I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. I dont regret reading it but it lacks in a lot of areas. Part of this is due to the fact that I dont know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. He is not a Phd or a relationship or family counselor. He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book and the other with his current wife. When it comes to relationships I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf. I support the crux of what Harris talks about. I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. The book is chivalrous and romantic. It is a hopeful book.  But it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship. If you are into reading relationship books just be sure this isnt your only resource.,4.0,5.0,Joshua Harris,sorry sarcastic title ive read most book im still reading last chapter which actually most hopeful chapter ill start what liked harris lays out some good suggestions handling pyhsical aspects dating relationship or courtship if get caught up semantics however harris offers nothing else except rudimentary courtship model involves physical boundaries guarding against things moving too quickly think good wisdom book completely lacks many other apects pursuing relationship talks very little about communication skills also wont find much personality traits or compatibility when began relationship girlfriend read book dont regret reading lacks lot areas part due fact dont know what credentials joshua harris make his claims not phd or relationship or family counselor had two substantial romantic relationships his life one girl who inspired him write his first book other his current wife when comes relationships would hardly call joshua harris authority subject no more experience or wisdom average person who would pick his book up off shelf support crux what harris talks about respect fact him his wife shannon waited wedding day first kiss book chivalrous romantic hopeful book paints only partial picture how persue relationship if into reading relationship books just sure isnt only resource

McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts as well as more often homosexual. The men with the exception of leading man Tony Hill are mostly all egotistical back-stabbing power-hungry morons of the lowest order while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger.

Cromwell,California,While this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers dont exist.  Ill admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality but just how far can we take this kind of analysis?  The author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent he can determine the birth order of your ideal match.  My father was 3rd and I was 2nd thus I should pair with a 4th born.  Anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science.  There are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions.  Not every Nth born is the same and no relationship between Nth and Mth borns can be analysed this way.  As with astrology the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong sign.  Whos to say I wont get along with a 2nd born?

Kagans thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter The Power Gap Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - Psychologies of Power and Weakness. Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies but change perspectives as well. He claims Europes paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into Hyperpussiance a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia highlighting Europes failure and Americas effectiveness in handling the situation.

Diller,Ft. Wayne IN,I suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda.  That being said in this book Mr. DiLorenzo seems to play fast and loose with the facts (or at least with his conclusions).The flyleaf of this book promises extensive research and meticulous documentation but at least one other reviewer has already pointed out some problems with this authors historical research.  That should raise a red flag to anyone reading this book. Consider this:  The author claims Lincoln was more interested in building an American empire by centralizing Federal power than ending slavery.  This implies Lincoln was premeditated in what he would do as President.  I challenge anyone who believes that to read Lincolns actual words and more importantly examine his actions.This we know:  Abraham Lincoln was a complicated man and as a thoughtful person his views on slavery changed during his many years in public life.  He came to believe that slavery would not die out on its own.I do recommend purchasing and reading this book since it is so different from the mythical view we have of Lincoln today.

I dont understand for whom this book is written. It is full of painfully obvious advice such as Dont play with your food or Do not throw golf clubs... in anger. Anyone raised in America (presuming that is the authors intended audience) who doesnt already understand these things and take them to heart isnt going to be interested in reading about them in a book if they can even read. Chapter 15 deals with Staring and differences where the author admonishes: Do not repeat racist sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence. If you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this. If you are this book isnt going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it. I found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet. If the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated dream on! I think the author has a Professor Henry Higgins Jones.

By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room. Admittedly Depression makes for a tough topic but thats not good enough.Theres more to Depression than staring at an empty page unable to muster the courage to write one single word. The dark places of the soul also have their fires their drama even if they are played out in secret. I will grant that the writing is spare and elegant as you would expect. But I would have traded all the insider literati name-dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt something that put me there with him. I have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction. Styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism but the self-destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego frequently it heralds the triumph of ego.

DeyoDavid Leibowitz,books,1,Horrible horrible book.,September 27 2006,Steven Gallo,New York City,As someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it. After reading many of these Amazon reviews though I opted out of a purchase and took it out of my Bronx library instead. Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time and not any money.This book is a sham. It is obviously mostly fiction. And its boring fiction at that. The book is divided into chapters each chapter a new adventure. I read the subway one first where the explorers take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line to see the City Hall Station which opened in 1904 (NYCs first station) and closed in 1948. The station is located on the loop of the 6 train that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop Brooklyn Bridge. First of all anyone can go on this adventure. Just stay on the train at the last stop Brooklyn Bridge and thats it. Despite the authors attempt to make this sound risky no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care) just sit down. The author created some European tourists that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying are we on the wrong train? Well unless all those huge 6 signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read then you probably got on the correct train. The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11. This chapter was a joke.I started reading the other chapters and saw they were no better. I then started to breeze through the book. One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all. This despite the fact that on page 67 the author states Josh takes out his camera,,,L.B.

Crocker III,books,1,Self-laudatory nonsense and insulting to anyone with half a brain.,March 6 2006,David DeMaggio,,I received this book as a gift.  I was skeptical upon reading the praise for the book on the back cover from such political wonks as Bob Novak and Sean Hannity.  Havent any well respected catholic theologians or scholars approved of this book?  No.  And with good reason.  Its not a history book its a poorly researched piece of garbage designed to bilk the faithful out of their hard-earned dollars.I did read several chapters of the book to be fair.  When Crocker describes the Papal forces during the Albigensian crusade as soldiers of God overcoming all the odds to destroy the wicked oppression challenging the authority of the church.  I wanted to puke.  And how about the Inquisition where Church authorities sanctioned physical torture against heretics?  Well Crocker concedes that torturing someone might stray a little bit from Christs original message of tolerance... but hey they threatened the authority of the righteous Catholic church so they got what they deserved.  Uh yeah amen brother.  These considerations aside the book isnt even well researched which immediately destroys its credibility with me.  For example from the Albigensian crusade Crocker states that the armies of the heretics numbered over 100000 yet with only a few thousand men the Pope was able to defeat them as they were filled with the glory of god or something like that.  Curiously in his footnotes he cites nothing to back this claim up.  Maybe because it isnt true.  And any cites to books that have been critical of church policy like say endorsing Mussolini are derided as unresearched politically motivated and shamefulIronically thats exactly what Triumph is to me,4.0,27.0,H.

Ross,Washington DC,Like many others in my book group I had been looking forward to finally reading something by Pamuk. And like most of my book group I was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him. Originally published in Turkey in 1985 the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive. He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated but much of it cant. This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes. Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuks earlier book The House of Silence. Such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino Borges and their ilk.The basic plot is very straightforward: in the mid 17th-century a young Venetian gentleman is captured by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring Turkish scholar who happens to look just like him. The two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together engaged in various psuedo-intellectual investigations of astronomy biology engineering and so on. These bring them to the attention of the Sultan (based on Mehmet IV) whose patronage waxes and wanes culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine. Along the way their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague whose outcome they are tasked with predicting. The book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the readers assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it. Namely are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person?This all unfolds at a glacial pace and the two characters are mere ciphers. Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than ,18.0,30.0,Orhan Pamuk,like many others book group had been looking forward finally reading something pamuk like most book group fairly disappointed short early novel him originally published turkey 1985 story prefaced introduction which one faruk darvinoglu purports have discovered manuscript dusty archive then goes explain parts story can historically corroborated much cant should immediately alert reader not take everything book comes even more so if reader knows darvinoglu protagonist pamuks earlier book house silence such intertextual tricks immediately bring mind works calvino borges ilkthe basic plot very straightforward mid 17thcentury young venetian gentleman captured turkish raiders sold into slavery aspiring turkish scholar who happens look just like him two men then spend next few decades cloistered together engaged various psuedointellectual investigations astronomy biology engineering so bring them attention sultan based mehmet iv whose patronage waxes wanes culminating lengthy attempt construct powerful war machine along way claustrophobic relationship swings back forth interrupted outbreak plague whose outcome tasked predicting book concludes brief section which challenge readers assumptions calls into question everything comes before namely there two characters or just manifestations two aspects single personthis all unfolds glacial pace two characters mere ciphers clashing wills ideas take up page after page reader always told about conflict rather than

Michael Feazell,books,1,From Christianity...To Churchianity,May 23 2005,Bill Turner,Old Bridge New Jersey United States,The author comes off as a whining unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a stifling church environment; further apalled by the Church Founders belief in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was Gods True Church through the ages right on up to the present end time. Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrongthe Churchs actual teachings and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole labeling it a cult...and further damning its Pastor General as a heretic despite the Churchs humanitarian works publishing Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W. Armstrong. Since Armstrongs death in 1986 Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days sabbaths ten commandments (which in his estimation are now the ten suggestions) and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination. Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership as over 100000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W.

B Garrison,Oklahoma City OK USA,John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst) so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people survivors of the Holecaust believe they have seen the Shadow Man.  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.Eventually Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man a man of pure evil.  As the book villian it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also this book barely touches on WWII yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  Ive read a lot of great WWII novels and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasnt too exciting.  It wasnt exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.Finally I realized I didnt like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.The review from Publishers Weekly printed above ,3.0,3.0,John Katzenbach,john katzenbach accomplished author had previously read enjoyed another his novels analyst so surprised how bad shadow man premise plot four very old jewish people survivors holecaust believe have seen shadow man shadow man jew who joined forces nazis find jews hiding avoid certain doom concentration camps four old people feared shadow man more than anything when one them killed retired police detective named simon winter looks into who shadow man meanwhile miami police also investigating death elderly jewish woman have young gangster suspecteventually winter police district attourney join hunt shadow man man pure evil book villian hard fear villian who killer 50 years ago now his 70s also book barely touches wwii yet purports times novel about wwii ive read lot great wwii novels book would have been great if had been set 60s setting present day senior citizens main characters wasnt too exciting wasnt exciting primarily because wondered where had shadow man been all years why starting kill now shadow man had no motivation killfinally realized didnt like book when skipping paragraphs time during last 20 pages entire book like each character prone long rambling inner thoughts really added nothing story if take away wwii angle novel bad wwii angle adds some excitement there probably thousands books out there relate horror wwii better than one doesthe review publishers weekly printed above

The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.  What Ive loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book however was truely repulsive.

His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins. He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually DNA. Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication (along with the traditional chemical communication) Narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by DNA (which often show up as snakes) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of DNA (which is conscious) and the entire linked network of DNA based life. As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through light as spirits.From there he goes on to say that all ladders staircases and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking,2.0,3.0,Jeremy Narby,jeremy narbys cosmic serpent dna origins knowledge started out decently enough narby reminiscing about his days doing field work amazon basin there goes over some interesting ideas regarding dna serpent myths then all goes down hill suddenly becomes follower intelligent design makes all out attack darwinian evolution science itselfa number narbys ideas regarding dna shamanism intriguing enough apparently decided all shamanism based molecular biology while freely admits being very reductionist point still see many problems his view shamanism based molecular biology heart his argument mostly surrounds symbol serpentdragon which present many different mythologies often connections water associations twins decides actually representation dna viewed shamans believes all serpents mythology shamanic visions actually dna since dna emits photons been shown possibly play part cell communication along traditional chemical communication narby believes shamanic trances shaman becomes able see light emitted dna which often show up snakes shaman communicates individual bits dna which conscious entire linked network dna based life justification argument points out some groups hold spirits beings pure light him almost literally correct spirits actually dna communicate through light spiritsfrom there goes say all ladders staircases ropes shamanic quests representations dna when shaman uses them travelling along dna similarly when shaman goes underworld sinking

While I have only read a limited selection of her work in these essays &quot;Against Interpretation&quot; being the ultimate example Sontag emerges as a simple-minded arrogant ignoramus. In her utterly unreasoned invective  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontags flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldnt possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinbergers excellent  &quot;Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei&quot; which adroitly considers  the subject hadnt been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldnt have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontags  writing,13.0,42.0,Susan Sontag,fail understand all hoopla about susan sontag while have only read limited selection her work essays quotagainst interpretationquot being ultimate example sontag emerges simpleminded arrogant ignoramus her utterly unreasoned invective sontag ignores or just unable understand two critical facts first some works art theory difficult understand varying degrees without help interpretation sontags flawed analysis supposed ruination works kafka interpretation demonstrates not only she among crowd she clearly reached new unheard misguided heights second sontag ignores fact works art other languages cannot understood translation without help interpretation criticism demonstrates extent which aspects certain culture imbedded original language couldnt possibly clearer than poetry weinbergers excellent quotnineteen ways looking wang weiquot which adroitly considers subject hadnt been released when sontag published essay probably wouldnt have made difference what she thinking only good aspect essay why give 2 stars instead 1 or zero fact given ample opportunity win arguments against individuals who flawed thinking enough enjoy sontags writing

Now I am not above accepting bedroom advice where its warranted (for instance it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie wed just went to see).  But Grays generalizations dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so. Although Im the first to admit that women love compliments Grays suggestions as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and occasionally what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase your breasts are wonderful?

Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how while getting to the undressing part the man should pull the womans panties up her crack (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And dont miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when shes in the mood and at half when shes not (or maybe it was different colors I couldnt read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways be it foreplay flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists) that a man always comes (and too quickly of course) and that you ,3.0,3.0,John Gray,stumbled across book accident library decided what heck all millions reading grays franchise cant wrong plus ive seen gray larry king once seemed like nice reasonable enough guy book though promising intro sexy touched more comical than sensual nerves now am not above accepting bedroom advice where warranted instance thanks dr gray finally made sense night years ago when husband slept couch after huge fight caused criticizing movie wed just went see grays generalizations dumbing down most issues sharing his own sex life his wife bonnie mostly unhelpful suspect passages found funny involuntarily so although im first admit women love compliments grays suggestions displayed several top 10lists things say occasionally what not say tidbit too repetitive ever wonder how many combinations can play phrase breasts wonderful read book almost enlightening hot tip how while getting undressing part man should pull womans panties up her crack aka give her plain old wedgieno joke dont miss one where mongolian woman pulls flag full mast when shes mood half when shes not or maybe different colors couldnt read clearly through tearsno offense mongolian peoplemore annoying recurring very stereotypical assumptions woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than man various ways foreplay flowers or favored seduction line hit lists man always comes too quickly course

I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means but I just couldnt get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as dear heaven and lord were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book which doesnt seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma however).  As another reviewer said the big mystery of why Daisy wouldnt leave Geneva wasnt particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didnt care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.

Gould rambles on and on attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science.

Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles Stingo the narrator is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of 47 which he is relating he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends tragedies and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous far over-written especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.In the end the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?

When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage Gracie finds herself without love without friends and most importantly without status.  (But at least shes still got the money!)Actually most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes its hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that theyre impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly lacking polish wit or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazers insistence on using Gracies name as much as possible.  For example:Gracie thought about it; theyd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased in the beginning.

What a dissappointment! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread wake up! Reinharts book is simply flawed. Compared to other bread books its even a quite average book. But one that is luxuriously packaged. A lot of hot colorful expensive air. And its expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it but because of the super luxuriously editing. This is a book for book enthousiasts not for bakers professional or home.

397,1843533847:good_book_but_in_the_wrong_way:mrliteral,1843533847,The Rough Guide to Cult Movies - 2nd Edition (Rough Guide Sports/Pop Culture): Books: Paul SimpsonHelen RodissMichaela Bushell,books,3,Good book but in the wrong way,November 14 2006,mrliteral,Woodland Hills CA United States,As a romantic comedy Star Wars is a failure.  As a science fiction film the Annie Hall is a complete disappointment.  Whatever other merits these movies might have there are definitely areas that they are lacking.  Which brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies:  as a reference book it is highly suspect.  Whats notable is that Annie Hall fails as sci-fi because it doesnt try to be that genre; The Rough Guide fails at the very category it aspires to.  Which is too bad because it is often an interesting read.The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless.  We then a series of chapters representing various genres some of which are valid (science fiction westerns horror) some of which are ridiculous (Animals Food Nuns) and some of which are not even true genres (dubbed independent straight-to-video).  After this we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia.The movie descriptions are often amusing although there are numerous errors (such as misstating Geoffrey Rushs role in Pirates of the Caribbean) even more omissions (every reader will find his own; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out.What saves this book is even though it fails as a reference book it is nonetheless entertaining.  I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one.  Its a rather useless book especially if you want to learn more about movies but if you do pick it up it is probably the most entertaining two-star book that youre ever likely to read. ,0.0,1.0,Paul SimpsonHelen RodissMichaela Bushell,romantic comedy star wars failure science fiction film annie hall complete disappointment whatever other merits movies might have there definitely areas lacking which brings rough guide cult movies reference book highly suspect whats notable annie hall fails scifi because doesnt try genre rough guide fails very category aspires which too bad because often interesting readthe failure starts beginning book definition cult movies so broad meaningless then series chapters representing various genres some which valid science fiction westerns horror some which ridiculous animals food nuns some which not even true genres dubbed independent straighttovideo after get various miscellaneous topics thrown without rhyme or reason such list top movie grosses followed presidential movie triviathe movie descriptions often amusing although there numerous errors such misstating geoffrey rushs role pirates caribbean even more omissions every reader find his own one example unforgiven missing westerns plenty movies really miscategorized seem only placed specific genre fill outwhat saves book even though fails reference book nonetheless entertaining am therefore giving two stars instead one rather useless book especially if want learn more about movies if do pick up probably most entertaining twostar book youre ever likely read

Elgin akitonmyers,Palo Alto CA,All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family but his brothers friend a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.And thats only the start of the plot. Its really pretty bad it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of Americas worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this try one of Harlan Cobens last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read look for Denis Lehane he wrote the amazing Mystic River but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well.,2.0,4.0,David BaldacciTony Roberts,all can say pass some aspirin dozy bad novel says dust jacket supreme court law clerk grabs petition ends up becoming deceased up brother uncover truth finding real killer who had let poor black man rot away crime did not commit same time brother contends mysterious bad guys out get him stop unearthing evidence not only does deal his family his brothers friend sexy young law clerk herself duplicity bench she works forand thats only start plot really pretty bad descends into mired pretensions goofy resolutions characters so shallow left little notion who except faint nasty after taste over conceded ways baldacci along james patterson dean koontz one americas worst authors if want author who writes similar vein try one harlan cobens last four or so stand alone thrillers out character myron bolitar or more sophisticated read look denis lehane wrote amazing mystic river his pi series located boston pretty good well

The book starts in 1936 although most knowledgable people know that the march to war really began with the Japanese seizure of Manchuria in 1932.  The author continually repeats the refrain that Americans dont understand the Japanese mentality and culture and it was this misunderstanding that led to the war. It is true that Toland defines the Japanese term gekokujo as being some sort of insubordination that led to the Kwantung Army to feel it could move presumably without orders from Tokyo into Manchuria. However Toland does not explain how this could happen. There is little description of the power structure in Japan we do know that there was some attempt to create parliamentary democracy but there were also the giant oligarchs who had much power plus the military hierarchy.  Somehow the military took control in the 1930s but Toland doesnt really say how.   He describes in detail the 2/26 Uprising of young officers in 1936 and how they were willing to kill without compunction and how fanatical they were yet we are then told that they OPPOSED expansion into China and that the repression of this coup attempt would lead to an expanded war in China.  I must say I dont understand this at all...Toland potrays them as militaristic fanatics yet they seem to be the good guys.  Werent those who supported expansion into China also militaristic fanatics?  This is left totally unexplained. Toland then goes on to describe the fatal Incident at the Marco Polo Bridge in 1937 near Peking (Beijing) which led to the full-scale invasion of China.  Toland says the government in Tokyo again had nothing to do with it in fact both the Chinese and Japanese commanders on the spot tried to calm ,8.0,8.0,John Toland,must say after reading book am more confused than ever origins war between japan us book starts 1936 although most knowledgable people know march war really began japanese seizure manchuria 1932 author continually repeats refrain americans dont understand japanese mentality culture misunderstanding led war true toland defines japanese term gekokujo being some sort insubordination led kwantung army feel could move presumably without orders tokyo into manchuria however toland does not explain how could happen there little description power structure japan do know there some attempt create parliamentary democracy there also giant oligarchs who had much power plus military hierarchy somehow military took control 1930s toland doesnt really say how describes detail 226 uprising young officers 1936 how willing kill without compunction how fanatical yet then told opposed expansion into china repression coup attempt would lead expanded war china must say dont understand alltoland potrays them militaristic fanatics yet seem good guys werent who supported expansion into china also militaristic fanatics left totally unexplained toland then goes describe fatal incident marco polo bridge 1937 near peking beijing which led fullscale invasion china toland says government tokyo again had nothing do fact both chinese japanese commanders spot tried calm

Li SJCA Teacher,Sunnyvale CA United States,This textbook is more useful for the flashy (and admittedly very good) teachers ancillaries. But this review is not for the ancillaries. It is for the text itself.The texts treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough. The diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing compiling numerous different concepts into one problem. While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another it doesnt make sense that most instead of some diagrams are over-complicated. Personally I dont like the format with the examples mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become LITERATE in math not just a good example comparer. The text has little actual TEXT to speak of.I have not been teaching HS for very long but I do not like this book. I am not a textbook dependent teacher but I do (woefully) recognize that students have poor study skills and dont reference notes all the time. I do not teach out of the textbook and I spend many hours planning lessons lecture notes my own examples etc. I had many complaints that the problems were confusing included too many ideas at the same time etc. Some may be successful in teaching themselves from the examples but I am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have TEXT. I may be a math teacher but I understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material. On the other hand the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets study masters note taking guides etc. Perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text.,12.0,13.0,Ron LarsonLaurie BoswellLee Stiff,textbook more useful flashy admittedly very good teachers ancillaries review not ancillaries text itselfthe texts treatment proofs very cursory not rigorous enough diagrams algebraic problems too confusing compiling numerous different concepts into one problem while agree students must learn differentiate one propertytheoremrulepostulate another doesnt make sense most instead some diagrams overcomplicated personally dont like format examples mainly because downplays necessity students become literate math not just good example comparer text little actual text speak ofi have not been teaching hs very long do not like book am not textbook dependent teacher do woefully recognize students have poor study skills dont reference notes all time do not teach out textbook spend many hours planning lessons lecture notes own examples etc had many complaints problems confusing included too many ideas same time etc some may successful teaching themselves examples am very disappointed textbooks no longer have text may math teacher understand importance reading how helps person process material other hand teacher resources great set worksheets study masters note taking guides etc perhaps authors spent more time resources instead text

I was disappointed soon after when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella who comes across as this loving mother who puts her kids before anything else works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isnt there to oversee everything even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband she just does it. Unless of course it was in the last 50 pages which I didnt bother to read because I just couldnt torture myself any longer.  And Im a big fan of Roberts.

Ross,Washington DC,The first book of Austers New York trilogy was originally published in 1985 and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. Ive never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy) so I cant comment on Karasik and Mazzicchellis adaptation. However I can say that since Im not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Austers story) this really didnt do anything for me at all. The story is basically an exercise in metafiction and if you like that stuff great -- I do not. It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre but thats just window dressing. (Theres a long legacy especially in France of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillets two books The Erasers and The Voyeur or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.)The story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. (The writer Paul Auster and his family shows up for one scene -- its that kind of book.) Quinn meets with the strange man who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father who was seeking to discover the true language of God. The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man hes been following and his clients. He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. Once he realizes theyve disappeared he finds his own life has disappeared as well. Obviously this is all somewhat about identity but its more about fun stuff like language representation and other tiresome postmodern subjects,4.0,4.0,Paul Auster,first book austers new york trilogy originally published 1985 1994 adapted into graphic novel ive never read original or any other parts trilogy so cant comment karasik mazzicchellis adaptation however can say since im not particularly fond existentialist or postmodernist literature two terms being most common critical shorthand austers story really didnt do anything all story basically exercise metafiction if like stuff great do not dressed up least initially mystery genre thats just window dressing theres long legacy especially france cloaking novels films ideas genre trappings example alain robbegrillets two books erasers voyeur or films jeanpierre melvillethe story begins fairly straightforwardly reclusive writer potboiler mysteries named daniel quinn lives new york his own since death his wife son complete stranger calls him thinks quinn private detective named paul auster begs him take his case writer paul auster his family shows up one scene kind book quinn meets strange man who raised rather harrowing circumstances his professor father who seeking discover true language god father been released jail quinn supposed keep eye him report everything starts derail when loses track both old man hes been following his clients spends several months watching building going crazy once realizes theyve disappeared finds his own life disappeared well obviously all somewhat about identity more about fun stuff like language representation other tiresome postmodern subjects

Macdowell,NY,Paul Austers City of Glass is perhaps the worst read Ive experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical existential tour de-force I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life love death a myriad of wonderful symbols and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life well then good for you.  But in reality the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker.

However upon opening the book my first thought was these all look like high school yearbook photos which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that thats primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern which he stresses throughout the book is creating a saleable picture and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom since shes usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been How To Take High School Senior Pictures.Even then most of the pictures are not very good both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition the poses are unnatural and awkward looking and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.To be fair the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject but there is really very little useful information here.So if youre interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait this may be the book for you.

427,0195182499:gary_-_lost_christianities:gary_gary,195182499,Lost Christianities: The Battles for Scripture and the Faiths We Never Knew: Books: Bart D. Ehrman,books,1,Gary - Lost Christianities,August 14 2006,Gary Gary,Kirkwood NY,Ehrmans work is not for a person of faith. It does not take faith into consideration. It is a wonderful research project based on limited documents available - most forged and falsified; and none which can be validated. I read it as an immediate follow-up to his work Lost Scriptures - Books that did not make it into the New Testament. I was warned by my minister who is also a Bible scholar and has two Ph.D.s - and my minister was correct. In Lost Christianities Ehrman seems to make an effort to discredit our current books of the New Testament by implying that many New Testament books may be false forged translated incorrectly altered to serve a purpose etc... Ehrman clearly attempts to form a relationship between the New Testament books to those falsified books that did not get into the New Testament. Ehrmans Lost Christianities starts out strong but ends weak to the point of losing and disinteresting the reader. If for nothing else it is an attempt to test your faith but in the end your faith will be strenghtened - if you have faith. The book leads one to believe that the author is as much a Bible critic as he claims to be a scholar. He does present all sides of the New Testament story and it is interesting how the New Testament was formed. However the lack of confirmed and validated documents will lead one to begin to question if Ehrman is accurate or merely sensationalizing much like the media does. To save you the time and money simply let your faith answer any questions you may have on the validity of the New Testament and how came to be. Ehrman and other Bible critics (ie. The DeVinci Code) seem to be profiting by creating questions about the truth and validity of the New Testament story. Save your money and give it to your church instead.  Gary,18.0,48.0,Bart D.

Fernandez,Santa Cruz CA,From about the second page of this book I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys the women are all large-assed or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters sexual proclivities was so completely dumb not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person but Tucks descriptions are completely banal).

But as literature (read into that word what you will) its an abysmal failure. Crammed with so many jokes puns outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action ones interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. Its a case where you cant see the forest for all the intervening trees. I had expected a straight tale similar to the Alienist.  Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up.  It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing.  Toward the end it descended into caricature.  Whats sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media.

I liked them all except Dead Sleep which by the way was much better than this one!Anyway despite Dead Sleep if I see a book by this author I havent read yet Id grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much. So when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea a stupid one but creative nonetheless.As for the characters I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldnt care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because hes like a cameo in this book and didnt have a character development nor adds anything to this book.In conclusion I would not recommend this especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless Im going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers.,2.0,5.0,Greg IlesDick Hill,ive read most books written greg iles liked them all except dead sleep which way much better than oneanyway despite dead sleep if see book author havent read yet id grab them right away without further thinking because enjoyed rest his work very much so when bought sleep no more prepared stay up all night because certain would thrilling wrongthe whole malloryevecoleetc thing just not believable all even though set memory imagination open author suggests still laugh when think explanation how mallory gets into another person she have sex have mindblowing orgasm should give greg iles some credit idea stupid one creative nonethelessas characters so appalled paranormal plot couldnt care less about any them read quiet game liked appearance penn cage just so blah because hes like cameo book didnt have character development nor adds anything bookin conclusion would not recommend especially who liked other books greg iles nevertheless im going continue purchase other books him because enjoyed his other works very much strongly believe one best fiction writers

And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why. While the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.

Instead I have focused on Of Mice and Men and his lesser known works such as To a God Unknown and my personal favorite Pastures of Heaven.  Ive been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.When I began reading In Dubious Battle it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbecks work.  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Macs radical cell.  There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar work secretly through letters go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  Early on the pace is fast exciting and engaging.Suddenly Steinbeck simply fails to deliver leaving the reader wondering when hes going to pick up the pace again.  After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a workers strike I expected the sense of excitement to continue.  It simply never does.Summary of In Dubious Battle - Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense......and eating.

The result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying.One symptom of the problems described above is that large portions are devoted to subjects other than money.  For example the author uses the first three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec ritual sacrifice in literally gory detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money.  I think thats meant to be what they used to call in show business a grabber but for the reader expecting to learn about money its a distraction. Another problem is that the authors grasp of modern economics is shaky at best and especially in the latter part of the book hell make a point and then repeat himself much as an undergraduate trying to extend the length of a term paper thats run a few pages short.And yet theres also some interesting and oddly convincing tidbits of information here. The author states that L. Frank Baums 1900 book The Wizard of Oz is really a parable about the need for a bimetallic dollar based on both gold and silver.  But even as it strikes you that this is an interesting bit of trivia you realize that its only a bit of trivia and has little larger significance.If youre looking for a economic history of money you should look elsewhere.  If youre interested in the cultural and sociological impact of money this may be more to your liking though I think it still falls short. ,5.0,7.0,Jack Weatherford,sort book get when author writes subject which only passing familiarity lacks confidence subject matter inherently interesting enough hold readers attention result book ultimately unsatisfyingone symptom problems described above large portions devoted subjects other than money example author uses first three pages after introduction describe aztec ritual sacrifice literally gory detail before proceeding use cocao beans commodity money think thats meant what used call show business grabber reader expecting learn about money distraction another problem authors grasp modern economics shaky best especially latter part book hell make point then repeat himself much undergraduate trying extend length term paper thats run few pages shortand yet theres also some interesting oddly convincing tidbits information here author states l frank baums 1900 book wizard oz really parable about need bimetallic dollar based both gold silver even strikes interesting bit trivia realize only bit trivia little larger significanceif youre looking economic history money should look elsewhere if youre interested cultural sociological impact money may more liking though think still falls short

There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.  However the book has a very negative immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites ancient and modern that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated inaccurate and shallow.  After a while we began to think If Lonely Planet doesnt recommend it its probably interesting.

Ive read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror doom and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what Insomnia is. This isnt a spoiler just the authors note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10 1990- Nov 10 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.The other King books Ive read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  Insomnias Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong kind has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesnt come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesnt usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable like Ed and Helen Deepenau the three bald doctors and Ralphs numerous confidantes.Then theres the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant) it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.

He would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows.  I didnt even read the second story maybe Ill come back to that.  The third story was totally ridiculous as well.

Yet she stays with him.  He has given her an STD!!!  She stays with him!!!  She doesnt even like making love to him.

First of all Id just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first! Secondly if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.  Horrible! So basically this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesnt do a lot of introducing you to anything! Im on transistors right now and Ive spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet and guess what? Its using schematics I dont understand and yet again Im going to have to do more looking on the net.  This book is not worth it.  Dont buy it! Just please for your own sake find another one.  Also half the book is dedicated to projects.  That is actually building electronic circuits! Why didnt the author just entitle this How to build electronic devices then? Its beyond me! As far as explaining things are concerned the book does very little and assume you know more than you do.  Unfortunately Im going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook because this one is just horrible.  I was really wanting to learn something from this book but its just not happening.  For every chapter Ive read on this book Ive had to do research on the net and Im sick of it.  Im on pg. 154 and Im closing it.  DO NOT buy this book!

Second speaking of getting on your nerves half of what these authors say is ...as we talked about in the previous chapter or as well talk about in the next chapter. There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size and hell it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course. Third the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They dont know the meaning of clear and concise and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101.

478,0812693906:not_very_well_reasoned...patently_unoriginal:t._s._phillis,812693906,The Ayn Rand Cult: Books: Jeff Walker,books,2,Not very well reasoned...patently unoriginal,September 16 2005,T. S. Phillis,,Like most critics of Objectivism Mr. Walker focuses his criticism on Ayn Rands frailties and idiosyncrasies rather than the principles of the philosophy she founded.  My disappointment in his book was immediate and I have to say its as unoriginal a piece of writing as any other critic Ive read.  His cynicism drips from almost every sentence and his contempt for all things Objectivism is obvious to anyone who takes ideas seriously.  I cannot recommend this book even to those interested in contrasting views of her approach to philosophy; this book was written for those of like mind to the author...whatever mind they can be said to have.The body and scope of work done by Objectivist scholars whove never met Ayn Rand now ellipses her work - both fiction and non-fiction - and the work of her original core of thinkers.  To characterize the movement as a cult may have had some validity in the years prior to her death but only in the most remote sense of the word.  Right now the ranks of Objectivism are swelling with intelligent people who differ in background AND in opinion.  Mr. Walkers principle mistake is looking at Objectivism as something that was born exclusively from the mind of Ayn Rand...something Miss Rand herself would disagree with.  Objectivism is the logical continuation of a line of thought that views mankind as a reasoning animal...a line that extends back through history and begins (explicitly) with Aristotle.  Those (like Mr. Walker) who dismiss it on the basis of Miss Rands personality and the culture of people that grew around her in her lifetime are truly missing an opportunity to enlighten themselves.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading the personal experience of one man who happened to be in East Berlin before unification and then was able to see his file  afterwards.  However i am a bit disillusioned.  The story interests me but  Garton Ash really doesnt say anything!  I am disappointed that he so  poignantly and blatantly pokes at communism and a totalitarian state.  And  yet he does not back it up.  The book is good under the premise of  democracy good communism bad.  It feels like he is just pooling for  support.  And nobody knew the wall was going to &quot;fall&quot; when it  did.  I know of many professors who were writing books critiquing communism  who had to throw out their text because of the abrupt fall of communism.  Im wondering if this book is just a way to cash in an unexpected event.  I  am dissappointed.  Maybe i just dont know enough of Garton Ash but if this  is the case i should not have to feel the need to know his history before  reading the book.

What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories one after the other are about Kramers patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples. 1.

Now he could complete projects in one draft whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable his concentration keener.

He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.) 2. Sally: After four months on Prozac she looked brighter calmer self-assured in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.) 3. William M: The patients low self-esteem which had been present since his earliest childhood began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before.

Uren,Melbourne VIC Australia,Im really a great fan of Douglas Coupland which is perhaps much of the reason I found this book so disappointing. I hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new Microserfs since it totally lacks the insight wit and funny because its true apsects of the original. About the only thing it has in common with  Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry. jPod is set in a landscape of unreality with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric and for the most part unlikeable characters. It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that happened.Its not all bad and there were more than a few humorous moments and interesting plot twists. Couplands highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasnt changed. Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap in this book.

Peppo,Littleton Colorado,Why are there so many insanely positive reviews for this book?  Honestly what has this author contributed to the world with this book?  Was it the characters?  No theyve all been used and reused and used some more in practically every other work of fiction in the last fifty years (i.e. cocky and handsome FBI agent beautiful but dangerous killer with a past take-no-sh#t FBI boss etc.).  Was it the deep insight into the characters themselves?  A laugh out loud No!.  There was nothing coming close to character development.  Was there some new and clever writing style?  Unless you count having two page chapters revolutionary (I call it a way to have a two hundred page novella turned into a four hundred page novel).  How about the plot?  Was that something worth my time?  Not unless you havent ever watched suspence movie in your life.  So honestly what the hell makes this book worth anyones time?  All I can find in this book are two dimensional characters needless sub-plots ludicris dialogue and empty promises (were lied to about the main characters fate in the beginning and were lied to about this being a thriller in the vein of Hitchcock).  As a person who has turned to the world of novels to escape Hollywoods onslaught of needless pointless and time wasting strategy of churning out movie after movie of pure garbage I can trully say that this is the type of book that will doom us all into a market of hurried and horribly bad novels to take our hard earned money.

Matson,books,2,Its exciting it will sell but its just not happening,August 20 2005,Connor Rzasa,Massachusetts,&#65279;Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe focusing this time on the generation born after X.For those not already familiar with the authors theory Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991. They wrote the book Generations which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re-cycling types and each type comes of age during a different kind of era or turning. The Silent Generation is of the adaptive type for instance passive gentle and in tune with their emotions and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America. The Baby Boomers remembered for their Awakening in the 1960s are of the idealist type concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in but inclined to change during life (from hippie to the current Just say no control freak). Generation X which they named the Thirteenth Generation is of the reactive type being alienated street-smart and materialistic without a feeling of need to be loyal to anything coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s. They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the Millennial Generation and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic hard-working and clean-cut just like the G.I. Generation that fought World War II going back to the civic type generation before the Silent Generation. In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are. In their third book The Fourth Turning they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations. They also changed the archetype names from adaptive idealist reactive and civic to Artist Prophet Nomad and Hero.

It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx which was a complete failure.

The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. I dont understand how Kinsellas editor didnt draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. And her endless excrutitating inner reflections. Beckys exploits arent amusing anymore. Her purchases on her honeymoon arent wacky. Theyre bewildering. For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. And oh yes then she discovers a long lost sister. That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. I am not making this up. Its all there in the book. And none of it is even remotely entertaining.

It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. Its questionable how novel this metaphor is but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is like most sociological writing unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources many footnotes and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology this is probably a good place to start (again the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be its bane as an introduction).However the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.(The following is a charicature of the authors argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage All the world is not of course a stage but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals or groups of people and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)There are other arguments obviously and the statement we can draw a parallel with other situations is most of the content of the book which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence.

Id like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind Peggy Salingers memior about life with her father but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea. Although there are some interesting revelations about Salinger as a man his daughter doesnt seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of JD Salinger theyre the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday. Theres a lot of blame thrown around here and not a whole lot of admitting to ones own mistakes. Although this is probably to be expected its still frustrating since Margaret Salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her fathers good name and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical. (Complaining about your fathers desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea.)

Im sorry. I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies (Hell House included) I was really excited to read this. I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it soft porn to sick soft porn and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale. Sacrilege in a book called...Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up. Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary. I doubt these were Mathis sexual fantasies in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying. It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader. Similar to enacting horrible violence on children or worse babies in cinema (try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face). Mathis should not be condemned for content.Here is what he did right. He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science. Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story.The bad parts may be more numerous. His characterization is horrid. There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them. You will remember Barrett by his limp Fishcer by his fear Florence by her religious beliefs and Edith...well because there is no one else. They are paper thin and have no real motivations.

One can get the general gist but its best to read through fast then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.

I would definitely not recommend this book for anyone under 18!  If you like soap operas you may enjoy this book a lot.  If you are searching for the secrets of Rose Red or a good ghost story this is not your book.I read the story before the author was made known.  I thought it might be Stephen King or Tabitha King.  The writing style was far below Stephen Kings style and it was very erotic which I suspected Tabitha King to be the author.  However the accounts of Ellen were obviously written by a man as the erotic episodes were definitely not from the viewpoint of a woman.  So it was no surprise when the author was neither Stephen nor Tabitha but a male author I have never heard of.The book reveals almost nothing new about Rose Red and its secrets.  I would dare say that 90% of the diary goes on and on about Ellen and Johns wealth and extremely dysfunctional marriage.  On and on about Johns extramarital affairs Ellens withholding of sexual favors more affairs more withholding of favors more affairs more favors withheld.  The story is a vicious circle regarding this.  Its almost like she gets burned but yet continues to play with fire.  Very frustrating and almost boring as you read the same scenarios redundantly.  By the third time you know exactly what hes doing and how she will retaliate.  Silly.I mentioned above that the Diary of Ellem Rimbauer revealed no new secrets of the house.

527,0091740118:negligent:r._albin,91740118,The Second World War: Books: John Keegan,books,1,Negligent,April 13 2005,R. Albin,Ann Arbor Michigan United States,The very first thing you read in this book is a mistake.  The Prologue begins with a photo of German POWs at the end of WWI.  The photo caption states that the German Army at the end of WWI was unbroken and implies that Germany capitulated because of a loss of will on the part of its political leadership.  This is doubly misleading.  The German Army was soundly defeated on Western Front in 1918 and then began to disintegrate.  In 1918 Germany was essentially a military dictatorship run by Ludendorff and Hindenberg.  The political leaders who lost will were the German High Command.  Defeat on the battlefield and despair on the part of senior commanders hardly meets the description of an unbroken army.  Keegan is essentially repeating the pernicious stab in the back myth used by the German military and right wing propagandists to undermine the Weimar republic.  Its astonishing to see this published decades later by someone who is supposed to be an expert on such matters.   This type of error recurs throughout this book.  My favorite relatively minor error is Keegan moving the Ploesti oilfields a major strategic resource from Romania to Hungary.  See prior reader reviews for documentation of a number of factual errors of varying magnitude.  Just as important and in some cases even more important are Keegans failures to discuss crucial aspects of WWII.  He makes little effort for example to discuss the origins of the war.  Indeed his paragraphs on this topic suggest that he finds it too confusing to discuss.  Leaving aside his shirking of his obligation to discuss this crucial topic there are excellent overviews of 20s and 30s that are good guides to this admittedly formidable topic.  Instead of an effort to discuss the origins of the war we get a superficial and somewhat misleading discussion of how industrialization transformed military technology and organization.  Instead of a discussion of the sad history of the Weimar ,10.0,21.0,John Keegan,very first thing read book mistake prologue begins photo german pows end wwi photo caption states german army end wwi unbroken implies germany capitulated because loss part political leadership doubly misleading german army soundly defeated western front 1918 then began disintegrate 1918 germany essentially military dictatorship run ludendorff hindenberg political leaders who lost german high command defeat battlefield despair part senior commanders hardly meets description unbroken army keegan essentially repeating pernicious stab back myth used german military right wing propagandists undermine weimar republic astonishing see published decades later someone who supposed expert such matters type error recurs throughout book favorite relatively minor error keegan moving ploesti oilfields major strategic resource romania hungary see prior reader reviews documentation number factual errors varying magnitude just important some cases even more important keegans failures discuss crucial aspects wwii makes little effort example discuss origins war indeed his paragraphs topic suggest finds too confusing discuss leaving aside his shirking his obligation discuss crucial topic there excellent overviews 20s 30s good guides admittedly formidable topic instead effort discuss origins war get superficial somewhat misleading discussion how industrialization transformed military technology organization instead discussion sad history weimar

Everyone recognizes that far more books are being written and published than can be read. Why are people so anxious to be authors in such a market? One reason apparently embraced by the Goldstones is that it is so EASY to write a book! All you have to do is write down some reminiscences of your experiences. They dont have to be particularly interesting experiences. You dont have to do any research into your subject. If you describe what all the people you encounter are wearing if you go into details of how you found a babysitter for each trip you took if you quote verbatim phone calls from relatives and shop keepers (even if they are not interesting or witty) and if you describe the hotel rooms you stayed in you can finish the book in a couple of weekends! And readers can finish the book in a couple of hours with little harm done.The book does accurately represent the travails of beginning book collectors and I recognized some of my own experiences in the stories the authors tell. However the book does not take the effort to educate readers so that they can skip over common early errors nor does it attempt to answer many of the questions that the authors themselves raised when they first began collecting. What determines the price of old books? Why are first editions important? Why should Tarzan books cost more than great works of literature? These are good questions that anyone might think of when getting into book collecting and you will find the questions but not the answers here.The book is written in a breezy style that is easy to get through and if you have two hours at an airport to kill you could do worse than to read it. But by the time you arrive at your destination you will have likely forgotten most of what you just read because so much of it is ephemeral details of the authors own lives,11.0,14.0,Lawrence GoldstoneNancy Goldstone,number books written our society huge getting huger everyone recognizes far more books being written published than can read why people so anxious authors such market one reason apparently embraced goldstones so easy write book all have do write down some reminiscences experiences dont have particularly interesting experiences dont have do any research into subject if describe what all people encounter wearing if go into details how found babysitter each trip took if quote verbatim phone calls relatives shop keepers even if not interesting or witty if describe hotel rooms stayed can finish book couple weekends readers can finish book couple hours little harm donethe book does accurately represent travails beginning book collectors recognized some own experiences stories authors tell however book does not take effort educate readers so can skip over common early errors nor does attempt answer many questions authors themselves raised when first began collecting what determines price old books why first editions important why should tarzan books cost more than great works literature good questions anyone might think when getting into book collecting find questions not answers herethe book written breezy style easy get through if have two hours airport kill could do worse than read time arrive destination have likely forgotten most what just read because so much ephemeral details authors own lives

Choose Watership Down or other,June 5 2006,Sharon E. Neufeld,Fairfax VA USA,Fans of the ABC-TV show LOST will probably be buying Our Mutual Friend in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the last book [I] ever [read].  Since I did not have to buy it having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago I immediately set out to read it.What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is just a bit perhaps padded.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages. Dickens work is melodrama but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of The Old Curiosity Shop I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing.  OMF goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence. Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just cant help but feel contrived; and Dickens having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens but I assure you that my only concern is for you gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens oeuvre or are required to read Our Mutual Friend I would instead direct you to Dickens far superior works:  David Copperfield Oliver Twist Pickwick Papers.  If you are looking for LOST reading material I would refer you to Watership Down (Excellent) The Stand (by Stephen King entertainment not literature) The Dark Tower series (by Stephen King entertainment not literature and similar to Our Mutual Friend possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like Locke Rousseau and,6.0,18.0,Charles Dickens,fans abctv show lost probably buying our mutual friend droves after having seen desmond keeping last book ever read since did not have buy having purchased full set dickens years ago immediately set out read itwhat disappointment dickens wrote installment basis publishing magazine over 19 month period one cannot avoid sneaking suspicion while reading just bit perhaps padded any good editor could have tightened up least 200 pages dickens work melodrama some just more overwrought than compatible good art oscar wilde said old curiosity shop simply cannot read death little nell without laughing omf goes quickly down level bathos remains there last sentence even worse ending some endings just cant help feel contrived dickens having gotten large number his characters into drastic positions pulls so many strange colored rabbits out his hat reader simply feels cheatedall may seem rather harsh someone who willing shell out hundreds dollars complete oxford illustrated dickens assure only concern gentle reader unless possessed adequate time read whole dickens oeuvre or required read our mutual friend would instead direct dickens far superior works david copperfield oliver twist pickwick papers if looking lost reading material would refer watership down excellent stand stephen king entertainment not literature dark tower series stephen king entertainment not literature similar our mutual friend possessed fatally flawed ending or review philosophy like locke rousseau

What a bunch of baloney. First of all evolution in the sense of common descent is not impossible. Even ID-iot superstars Michael Behe Stephen Meyer and Jonathan Wells have admitted as much. (See a summary of their recent testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution/creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette. (wvgazettemail) (put /forums after com) So any ID-iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity (IC) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant.  Man evolved from non-human ancestors. Get over it. Thaxton in particular ought to read that summary since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly ID-iotic.  In any case the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab. Talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific especially to poorly educated ID-iots who generally are clueless about real science; but even if the empirical data is accurate its nothing but a facade because it has nothing to do with the books main conclusion. For example imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano. Skeptical you ask for proof. Simple your neighbor replies. See heres my dog and theres my piano. Only a moron would accept that as proof and yet ID-iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of proof from ID-iotic films like this. The problem with your neighbors proof is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano.  Neither of those issues however was the real,7.0,36.0,Charles B.

This however is not to be found in What Went Wrong?Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn for instance that A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument matching the ten fingers of the two hands following different routes in a common purpose; and finally the musical ensemble from duets and trios to the full orchestra. While this is all well and good and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of The Clash Between Islam and Modernity... that has led to the precarious times in which we live.Or on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850s. Big deal!What we dont learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb or his writing of the incendiary manifesto Milestones. Furthermore there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda though Usama bin Laden does appear albeit seemingly as an afterthought in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.So what went wrong?Beats me..,9.0,16.0,Bernard Lewis,post 911 world which book subtitled clash between islam modernity middle east published should not surprising reader would anticipate discussion factors led up awful day however not found what went wronginstead treated cerebral discussion various sundry esoteric minutiae learn instance distinguishing characteristic western music polyphony harmony or counterpoint begins simplest form choir which matched voices sing different notes planned sequence produce combined effect then comes keyboard instrument matching ten fingers two hands following different routes common purpose finally musical ensemble duets trios full orchestra while all well good may even mildly interesting some academic level hard understand how plays into discussion clash between islam modernity led precarious times which liveor another note harmony counterpoint learn robinson crusoe translated into arabic butrus albustani published late 1850s big dealwhat dont learn anything about rise militant islamism there no mention wahhabism or how fundamentalist islamic movement contributed rejection modernity muslim brotherhood also not found index nor there mention sayyid qutb or his writing incendiary manifesto milestones furthermore there not single reference alqaeda though usama bin laden does appear albeit seemingly afterthought what appears hastily added afterwordso what went wrongbeats

Shaparenko,Pismo Beach CA.,In a world desperate for health solutions the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have  not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity.  Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.Careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.  Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.  Elsewhere mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.  Alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.You might as well drink battery acid he said the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.  Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.  The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.The alkaline promoters including this books author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry ,18.0,27.0,Sang Y.

Spoilers ahead - please dont read on if you havent read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book Wideacre which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregorys novels so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book the sequel as Id bought it and it looked more promising.  It was marginally better as one reader put it than the first but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted Julias consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didnt marry him... ah because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although its not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that in fact for anyone at all.  I dont want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.

Its a shame really because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of whats good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.

Friedman,books,1,Not Recommended,June 26 2006,Dirk Avenue,and thoroughly enjoyed,Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Levitts Freakonomics I picked up Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life looking for more of the same. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). Facing an irate publisher he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes. As a result readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (Despite the glowing accolades on the cover the authors explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)The author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon but does not provide any answers. Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students such tactics are unconscionable. Of course the author may be priming the pump for sales of a Hidden Order Supplement.A final negative point is the authors tone which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory so it will not even be presented). While this may be true for a layperson reading the book being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.Overall if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library the last 40 pages are worth reading.

Walsh,,If you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions then this book may not be for you.  Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step-by-step through them including plot points in 3D movies and so on. The book also leaves a lot out in other areas such as dining (little coverage) getting around Walt Disney World and off-site hotels and dining.For me the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (by Bob Sehlinger) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides. That is it told me what might frighten a youngster what might bore an adult and so on but it didnt say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions. Just generalizations about the ride then specific warnings for different types of people.The only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide doesnt are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing. If you have an Internet connection you dont need the pictures.  And as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps you cant beat the Passporter book on Disney World.So for me the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the best trip planning library for Walt Disney World.  If you like you can also pick up the EZ-Guide as it also has some interesting maps and info.As for Birnbaums it really doesnt have anything to offer.

Friedman,books,2,Interesting Thesis but overlooking some important points,June 12 2006,Nikkita,New Orleans LA,Mr. Friedmans book begins with an interesting thesis defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth.  The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts.  However the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis or if he just felt the need to write a book.  Furthermore for every chapter in the book there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that with a little thorough thought or research dont make sense or can easily be disproven.  With these things being the case I find Friedmans argument a little hard to buy.  The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely however because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations.  His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question What should the government do to promote economic growth?  They dont push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasnt already been suggested in the past nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies. ,5.0,7.0,Benjamin M.

Henderson,books,2,Hardcore Jargon on Intersectional Group,June 16 2006,Jeffery Mingo,Homewood IL USA,For decades African-American studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side.  For years queer scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side.  This anthology tries to address that void.  It goes a long way in proving that black gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones.  The anthology has representative numbers of men and women.  In some ways its a Whos Who of Black Gay Academia including works from Cathy Cohen Dwight McBride and Jewelle Gomez.Still there is much about this book that frustrated me.  A few years ago a study was done of black LGBTs and most respondents said they hated the term queer yet the academics here champion it.  Really if queer is supposed to represent the four groups equally then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered.  This is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as Alice Walker Stuart Hall and June Jordan.  Often people of color is used when only blacks are brought up; Latinos Asians and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all.James Baldwin is brought up often here.  I understand that.  His writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously.  Still I kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers wont print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated.  James Baldwin deserves his crown in black gay letters but Im concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown.  Several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the Harlem Renaissance yet that group hardly comes up here.  James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency.Finally I had beef with many of the essays.  Charles Nero has ,7.0,9.0,E. Patrick JohnsonMae G.

Popop is very broad-minded. It pains him that anyone would bad-mouth such armed operations. They were perfectly justified he explains because of thousands of innocent Irish Catholics murdered at the hands of the British army.I know why thousands of murders are important to Popop. Without them while he might justify random bombings in his own mind he could hardly do so in decent company. But I live in Ireland not America where news of these murdered thousands has not reached us. Gerry Adams never said a word about them not wishing to be laughed out of the country. He had to make the most all these years of a dozen fellows caught in a crossfire in Derry in 1973. I guess he saved the big one for the broad-minded boyos in Boston. What of all those dollars that Popop broad-mindedly dropped in the Semtex collection box? They were not wasted. Thousands of Irish really were murdered - mostly not Catholics but all of them really dead - at the hands of the disorganization that Mr Adams always denied being a member of. To be sure his non-henchmen failed to terrorize the Northern Irish into caving in but his enforcer who can barely write his own name did get to be Minister of Education (Im not making this up; I couldnt).Oh and the book is quite thought-provoking. Theres a lot about Bushes Arabs and the wrong kind of tax-cuts that went over my head. Theres wit of a subtlety rarely seen since Voltaire - you can tell by the CAPITALS and !!!!. There are explanations of 9/11 to suit every taste whichever Bush you blame. Myself I suspect those Enrons. But Mr Moore did discover:THERE ... IS ... NO ... TERRORIST ...

Blilie Barbarossa,Twin Cities MN,Investment Biker: 1-1/2 stars just barely escapes the lowest possible rating.This is a book about what a Tom Wolfe-style Master of the Universe does on holiday. Its nearly impossible to have an adventure when you are carrying 10(!) platinum credit cards. He got cold and wet a few times worried about finding gas didnt always have hotel rooms up to his standards and had delays at some borders yawn.The adventure must have been resisting the urge to buy an airline ticket back to New York using one of his many Visa cards.I rode a bicycle around the world for 19 months at about the same time Mr. Rogers was having his adventure. I am stunned that he perceived so little in his long travels.  I dont know how someone could travel in foreign countries that extensively and end up completely unchanged by the experience.  However this fits perfectly with his huge arrogance which is truly the theme of the book.  He already knows it all and will tell you all about it.Which makes one wonder:  why did he bother to leave NY City in the first place?  I guess it was a good opportunity to pose with and boink the attractive and young (naive and pliable? -- certainly lubricious) daughter of one of his clients.  And a good opportunity to pump himself up by feeling superior to all those brown faces hes driving through.  The arrogance the arrogance!  Typical privileged right-wing know-it-all.  Id like to see him try to survive in the Peruvian highlands without all his money and fancy equipment.This is not a travel book: Mr. Rogers uses his trip as a way to sell a long economic rant. You can save yourself a lot of time by just reading his final chapter Afterword. I will summarize his position: governments are bad; smart rich guys like me are good (remember October 1929?).

I found this really disappointing since Iceland is very expensive and I was hoping to keep down costs (in reality this is almost impossible even eating at the grocery store I was spending 10 dollars a meal for bread and cheese) Furthermore Iceland is a very small country and it would have been very easy to have given a lot more details.As with any tour book some of the info is out of date.  some of the museums and businesses were closed including the Icelandic Phallogical Museum.  It also seemed that this book was written for the high season in the summer months.  I went in March and found the information on the offseason limited and sometimes inaccurate.

The thing that makes me sad is that shes just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth.

Morse adventurer,Glendale AZ USA,Unlike Cusslers other series I found this first story of the Oregon Files slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem I suppose for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also theres little to no character development even of Mr. Chairman Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesnt compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers.

A staple of the series 2d characters; but by this point when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story it becomes an annoyance a drag and overkill. - virtually zero gain.  the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission once accomplished (or not) is forgotten by the end of the book. The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments; sadly its very boring and slow. However...-... the book doesnt get good until the last fourth.  And that my friends is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series. By this point its obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it. However as I said things got really good in the last few chapters and led into Armageddon one of the best books in the series. How ironic. Thumbs way down for Left Behind: The Remnant.

He is an excellent and compelling writer but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear. It was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews around 500 BC. It was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland Scotland Wales etc. and their cousins the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today.  The author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology.,2.0,14.0,Thomas Cahill,mr cahills book offers interesting controversial take history excellent compelling writer his differentiation between pre post diaspora israelites when discussing celts several his books not always clear only postbabylonian diaspora southern kingdom israelites who came known jews around 500 bc postassyrian diaspora 721 bc larger tentribed northern kingdom israelites who became what today call celts who both island celts who populated ireland scotland wales etc cousins continental celts who sacked roman empire under many celtic tribal names who make up most northwest europe today author could perhaps clarify part his presentations european history reviewing losttribesnet or any other modern celtic site based contemporary archeology

Based on the theories of David Ricardo the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible.  In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs.  Fables like The Choice (or the free-market economy for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple.  Thats why the book is dangerous.  The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world but it sounds good.  The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable.

After writing so many intellligent suspenseful stories Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murders not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains but really who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. Its like bad language in humor--in general its just a cover for bad writing. In Hard Truth Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter the well-reasoned defense of nature the lush descriptions of each storys setting.

While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so no one can profit from them.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity.    At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me Id taken acid in London but....      Aside from Jimis use of the word fabulous being at best incredulous the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book and the credibility of its author are based on extremely suspect. At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrixs mother who passed away in 1958:Jimi baby she told her son I have to escape this   While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response   from the average readerthey are clearly  fictional. ,19.0,31.0,Sharon Lawrence,while applaud ms lawrence educating fans gross injustices within hendrix family having commendable understanding janie hendrixs psychological make up lost even many who within her orbit there some very serious credibility problems here while even idle hendrix fan knows jimi born king county hospital now harbor view lawrence states born home family friendouch jimi quoted allegedly verbatum throughout book some alledged tapes interviews no one seen or heard lawrence conveniently plans destroying so no one can profit themmeanwhile cigarette packs yes cigarette packs necklaces being sold via ebay or private collectors allegedly having belonged hendrix siting ms lawrence previous owner source authenticity one point she aledgedly quotes hendrix sayingthe lsd passed around san francisco fabulous discovery id taken acid london aside jimis use word fabulous being best incredulous fact hendrix had already tried lsd new york 1996 before going england subsequently monterey common knowledge among afficianados again makes all alledged direct quotes questionable who have listened read hundreds hours interviews available through collectors official releases press clippings also find some wording alledged quotes book credibility author based extremely suspect one point ms lawrence even offers aledged quote hendrixs mother who passed away 1958jimi baby she told her son have escape while quotes like can illicit emotional response average readerthey clearly fictional

After just finishing the 400+ pages book Bull! from Maggie Mahar which is an absolute ecxellent book about market cycles (although the more recent boom of 1982-1999) The great Crash was really hard to read. It totally shows its age (it was written more than 50 years ago). The language is hard to understand and some words seem weird in todays time. But its not just the language which makes this book not enjoyable. It is not written with much entertainment value and the book I mentioned earlier shows clearly that it is quite possible to write an very entertaining book about the stock market. It also is very superficial it doesnt go into much detail at all. It doesnt tell any examples of real people or anything which would make the book more readable. It lists names and companies without doing a good part of explaning why it lists them. Sometimes I was thinking to myself Please get to your point.That book was probably a good read in 1955 while people still could relate to most of the names he lists. But now (2004) there must be better books out there about the Crash of 1929.I give it two stars and not one (you cant give zero stars) because it has some interesting facts. Overall I would NOT recommend this book.

Davis,books,1,very disappointing...,September 2 2006,A Physician,Dallas TX USA,I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out Coughlins ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the authors overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as were reading this book for a soldiers account not that of an English grad student.This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Ficks One Bullet Away.  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlins character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a human side are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in One Bullet.  There is no connection between author and reader in Shooter.  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In One Bullet you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally Coughlins demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.To make matters worse the action isnt as well developed as in other titles.  The authors self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits with plenty of after-action chest thumping obscures the view of battle.

Rossi therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms.On the math side Rossi mentions Fibonaccis algorithm and phi two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancient Egypt though many like to suggest that they were. The Fibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J.  Sylvesters skeptical views of the RMPs 2/nth table are  reference point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci but not  a reference point of Egypt. Egypt used more subtle ideas like http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http://akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com .Yet Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC  easily wrote out 2/p series into short and concise unit  fraction series using a very simple partitioning method  (as Ahmes wrote out n/p answers in his false position  algebra problems ie. 5/19 written out in a long awkward  series using 1/12th as the first partition as he did for 2/19 as describe a couple paragraphs below.

USA,I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson. This most difinitive unproven statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he seems to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what reason he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.  From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study) Mr. Wades analysis of this is extremely limited in fact it is extremely biased. Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co. Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges.

Women are raped abused beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification. This is an epidemic problem and Christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population.So here comes another book on male sexuality for Christian men. The idea is good: rein in the beast. But the major defect which sinks the book is the self-centered nature of the remedy. Christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty. What we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion. Its all self-centered. Who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives daughters and loved ones? At least Im sexually pure. Surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large? This is a life and death situation. We will be successful according to the goals we set. It is not enough for men to stop lusting. We need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society - ethics that arent greatly concerned with womens well-being. If youre only concerned with your own thoughts this book could be useful. But what about the sense of security for the women in our society who have to live with sexual aggression cat-calls and hey-babys?

It is touted as history yet not only does it lack any original historical material it  also lacks any discernable historical facts. Rather than history  &quot;Soul by Soul&quot; seems to be a mean-spirited emotional tract  designed to promote two fundamental ideas: 1. that white people living in  the antebellum South were universally loathsome brutish and cruel and 2.  that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble  good and abused. To support his views Professor Johnson strings together a  loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist  literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings. His personal  contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche  of the books long deceased characters and divine their true but unspoken  motives and thoughts. Quite a feat for any historian!      One loses count  of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using  their &quot;probing fingers&quot; in this book. Fortunately in between  probes the reader can be shocked by the &quot;killing fields of the lower  South&quot; the &quot;historical sexualization of black bodies&quot; the  &quot;slaveholders inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of  their slaves&quot; and the &quot;brutish perogatives of whiteness.&quot;  This is heavy hate-filled stuff worthy of a TV mini-series but it is out  of place in a supposedly serious history text.       I live in a former  slave quarter in New Orleans. In the antebellum period this building and  its resident slaves were interestingly enough owned by a free black who  was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation.

He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans or any other battle I have read.

Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the authors luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject.  Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations.I really dont understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book.  I dont care about the money I spent for the book.  I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun.  For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masis book).

Sadly Ben Albas Inventing Late Night: Steve Allen and the Original Tonight Show is not that book. It is largely a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with Allens TV contemporaries. These interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg (Sam Goldwin) or Neal Gabler (Walter Winchle). The opening chapter which addresses Allens dysfuntional up-bring education and his early days in radio and TV sets the stage for the authors failure to create a full-blooded well-rounded analytical portrait of Allen and his work. Alba draws here almost exclusively and certainly uncritically from Allens memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews. Taking Allen and the readers one independent witness at face value Allen had a rootless violent and unstable childhood. Given these negative conditions Alba gives  no hint of how why or even if Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family. The author gives us two brief stories from Allens adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured. Actually all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncles funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show. How did this dysfunctional world of Allens youth effect his two marriages and five sons? Why after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did Allen choose this same career field for himself? Alba doesnt even pose such questions about the boys effects on the man. He just plows ahead in a haliographic haze.

I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone let alone review after review would even come close to that stupefying conclusion. To me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with. Only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating. What it is is a bloated narcisstic misogynistic waste of time. Of course any piece of literature is subjective but to me this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should regardless of genre. Unless you love James Joyce (another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite) I think most readers expect some sort of plot development. Dont expect that here. How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel? You better pick up something else.  It seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the characters outcome. Far too pedestrian a thought if you get this art. If I cant have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable? Forget it non-ivy leaguer! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all so at least their loved ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings. The only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldiers hateful ruminations while oh by the way a war was being fought around them. Nope no big ending either. It just ends. Yes I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself. Give me a break.

The reverse has been almost standard practice of the Left when they cant refute the truth facts and common sense of conservatives.  Which is close to 100% of the time. So I have to be very careful not to copy the Left when I write as a fifth generation Kansan and having lived all of my life thus far in the same upper-middle class suburb Mr. Frank seems to so despise in his first and only book.   But his book was so filled with errors personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events people and general culture as to make it a book of fiction; not one of fact. He stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them.  He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasnt born into a poor family of migrant laborers.  Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice?  She is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life (not).  Living in and exposed to the surroundings of his childhood it appears to me his lifes goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth.   Hes so far at least succeeding in that!   Being an accomplished loser.   What a goal! His only accomplishment was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS.   Having written his fictional book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of lifes losing lottery he really has nothing else to say.   Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the same type of fiction over and over (as he just did for the NY Times).

Let me say first that the dialogue is completely modernized with not even a complex word to redeem it. I know this is because the original is supposedly in dialect but please our children are more sophisticated than that. Adam is self-involved careless and annoyingly stupid. Despite its touted 320 pages this could have been printed in 150 and contained much the same material. The only thing that redeems this novel from being totally forgettable is the snatches of Latin and Old English ballads scattered throughout. If you want your children to have a much clearer understanding of the times with a book focussed more on character than on plot or modern accessability have them read Song of the Gargoyle. Its also about a boy who loses his father and has to search for him in the company of a dog-like being but has ten times the depth and realism of this piece of trash. The boy is also a minstrel of sorts but he has more likable qualities than Adam as well as more adventures in less pages.

French,mostly disturbing but some apparrently enlightening,Well in my opinion there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing but some apparrently enlightening) but the question is is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  Im not saying that other lifeforms dont exist in the Universe (far from it) and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas but this idea that there are little menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically theres been the Barbarians Huns Mongols  Pagans Jews Christians Vikings black Natives Cannabals red Natives Mexicans Germans Nazis Communists now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80s.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked) they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit underground) than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and ,2.0,3.0,Whitley Strieber,well opinion there no longer any doubt some things appear flying our skies some people have had some unusual experiences mostly disturbing some apparrently enlightening question all seems fact matter various military branches around globe have real hardware could easily fool us holographic projections can used place images within our skys related controversial theories surrounding 911 events there devices can manipulate brain waves neuronal excitation have people hallucinate any scenario advanced drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories behaviour implants have been around decades have even gone mainstream now verichip im not saying other lifeforms dont exist universe far perhaps there number entities here earth carrying out agendas idea there little menacing greys abducting us various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect smells classic fear mongering elite love push us historically theres been barbarians huns mongols pagans jews christians vikings black natives cannabals red natives mexicans germans nazis communists now arabs next logical conclusion some evil force off planet because have used all boogey men earth even president reagan set us up scenario infamous speech late 80s fact known technology not including whatever may have not been leaked could quite easily pull hoax off even genetic manipulation cloning much further advanced practiced albeit underground than most people can fathom what become another fact major extent which ufo community been infiltrated

Proakis,books,1,3.64 lbs of Pure Spirtual Abuse ,October 26 2006,A Reader,California USA,John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry as with many com. theory persons Ive met since (GTRI in Atlanta GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially its their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis especially from an engineering perspective are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.John R. Barry for example is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldnt be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer John R. Barry as with the other followers of Proakis compares very unfavorably (in fact I dont consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the departments economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e. vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolies Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality arent so important).  There are far far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe engineer] is not mathematical ability memorized knowledge or even rhetorical shrewdness but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.

These forms of parochialism may be ethnic cultural religious nationalistic etc. depending on where you look. On one hand ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict (Jihad is Barbers label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants (McWorld is Barbers label for this).Thats the book.

Romanov Prophecy started in the right direction Third Secret was OK but I think he hit his *peak* right there.I really want authors to get better--heck I hope to write better papers as I go along in college.  But Steve Berry sorry.  And for all you people out there who dont like it when people give negative reviews of a book you like just hang on a second before you give me a big fat NO vote.  First of all even though this is fiction the whole Da Vinci Code genre purports to be based on fact.  Berry always writes his Note at the end to underscore this.  However if you want the reader to accept your plot please get some basic facts correct first.  The most annoying one for me as ahem a French major is the very dramatic chapter closer where they zip off to the Palais des Popes.  Excuse.  Me.  Popes?  Just because the English word looks kind of like the French word pape (for pope) doesnt mean you can flippantly swap them!  Eek.  And btw this is a real place so some editor somewhere should have noticed this.  Shame on you S.B.s editors.  OK Im not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever (it IS fiction after all) but really big glaring mistakes of geography or history cannot be tolerated.The other main issue I have with this book is the vehement attack on Jesus Christ and the resurrection and the Bible as a whole.  Cotton Malone our hero says that the Bible contains hundreds (Im paraphrasing) glaring inconsistencies.  If I remember correctly he says that one of the gospels (he picks on Matthew a lot) doesnt place Bethlehem as the place of Jesus birth.  That one doesnt hold water--I checked Matthew myself.  Says so in ch. 2.  I dont mean to thump the metaphorical Bible but who is Steve Berry to question the authenticity of the worlds #1 bestseller ever?

When I picked up this book I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. The book starts out promisingly even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. Were given the account of Charles Monet one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on Preston gives a description of the virus what it does how it does it - the works. Then he moves on to the Human Component the cast of characters so to speak for the big story.The big story is alas not so impressive. Its a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about but nothing of the sort happens. Basically people run around in bio-hazard gear fret a lot and monkeys die. In between Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus cases of people being infected crashing and bleeding out cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys unless youre a PETA type.The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book which is a noble idea but not when they dont die at the end. Basically hes trying to make you care about these people and all for naught. And by the time that youre supposed to be truly concerned you actually WANT them to die because youre tired of hearing about him describe in active detail what they eat in the morning what they do in the afternoon and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When youre addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaaxs hands and karate prowess?

Mitchell,candia new hampshire United States,This was a terrible disappointment.  More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.  There were however HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors actors film-writers magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.If viewed as a book about collecting books you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir there was little that was interesting about the authors life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.

Dumbrava,Spokane WA,If you are a Christian this book isnt for you. It is full of blashphemy concluding that we must ... forgive God and that we must love God ... even if He isnt perfect. Kusher even has the will to say that ...God would not be God... without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden when God said ...let US make man in OUR image he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.  Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that ... God so loved the world and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner and that it isnt your fault and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place.  for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God... The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people but it lied to them.

The reviewers who have lamented the short choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another without benefit of full explanation or connection are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didnt understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example the narrative is littered with sentences like: She made for the east exit...  Okay fine but did she run walk crawl hop skip jump or fly to the east exit?  I just dont know what to picture there.  The word made says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I havent read anything else the author has written so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder however why his editor didnt send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isnt one of them.

ColsonNancy PearceyHarold Fickett,books,2,Read this only with a wider range of Christian thinkers,June 13 2005,Nathan Eanes,Philadelphia PA,Toward the end of How Now Shall We Live Chuck Colson states regarding popular music and media that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet. However he warns a diet of junk food can be fatal.Good advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book. Yes it contains a kernel of truth but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as Thomas Merton St. Francis of Assisi Ron Sider Tony Campolo Brian McLaren Brother Lawrence Philip Yancey Wendell Berry-the list goes on. It often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern Church faces drawing the lines down to Christians against the naturalists or humanists thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the Church.While there is truth in Colsons writing I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class American thought and militaristic nationalism sprinkled with the politically correct amount of Christian belief. His faith seems to be overly academic one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines. Evangelism it seems to Colson is comprised heavily of apologetics. The secularists must be shown that they are wrong he says. Yes there is truth and there is time for debate but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships. You see I used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of secular humanists that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss. But as Ive grown I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from secular culture and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science.,7.0,37.0,Charles W.

Out of the blue a godfather appears a deus ex machina who offers an idealistic lawyer Clay Carter more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait a very sharp very large hook.  With apparent ease this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring as are their conversations their lack of values their hobbies their sex lives and their comeuppances.  Somehow even in their fall they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.Having read most of Mr. Grishams other books I expected better from him. ,2.0,2.0,JOHN GRISHAM,difficult nay impossible like book when all characters obnoxious money worshipping parasites exactly what have novel out blue godfather appears deus ex machina who offers idealistic lawyer clay carter more wealth than can imagine or use anyone brain would know there hook within bait very sharp very large hook apparent ease naive lawyer swallows hook makes millions millions dollars before so much senses deep trouble enthralled gaudy toys women money brings him immediately loses sight reality what hollow useless individual hires assist him whom associates his lawyer worldwhether or not there such individuals enron beside point may exist one am not eager hear life stories atmosphere which live boring conversations lack values hobbies sex lives comeuppances somehow even fall never lose all money never quite realize what hollow individuals arehaving read most mr grishams other books expected better him

Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel which is fine but he ends up putting the message above the story.   Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain in agonizing detail how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.   In the end none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesnt help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didnt care for this character I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits but I read novels for entertainment not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written I just didnt find the story interesting enough to recommend.For a better version of this story I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr.,2.0,2.0,JOHN GRISHAM,like john grisham king torts slowmoving disappointment grisham obviously making argument tort reform novel which fine ends up putting message above story grisham devotes much novel young plaintiffs lawyer his new law firm dedicated class action lawsuits provides grisham excuse explain agonizing detail how tort lawyers sue big companies collect huge fees grisham also produces scene after scene describing enormous wealth class action lawyers how put own greed above interests clients end none adds up engaging storyline doesnt help young lawyer novel rather unlikable person grisham obviously setting up fall since didnt care character found storyline king torts largely uninvolvingthis novel also rather preachy heavyhanded tone personally dislike class action lawsuits read novels entertainment not validate own political beliefs although book decently written just didnt find story interesting enough recommendfor better version story would suggest civil action jonathan harr

He comes off as arrogant showing little empathy towards Debras problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder depression social anxiety).  He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in but instead are very embarrassing to her.  He comes across as a husband with no compassion.  Its ironic that he goes on and on about Debras poor choices in boyfriends over the years and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra didnt keep the house tidy...and he didnt approve of the way she dressed!!  Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated.  He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is his GPA jobs earning potential etc...but then admits that when they separated he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off!  He says it was in her name so she can have it!  Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book.

It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I dont know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer but its worth a shot).  Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a glass looker - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use magic stones that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found gold plates and used what he called the Urim and Thum (which by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).

Gould rambles on and on attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science.

Dont get me wrong it wasnt terrible it just wasnt very good.Im not sure whether the book is a memoir a novel or a philosophical treatise. In Zen Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son Chris in the 1970s. But the story I guess is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:    The Buddha the Godhead resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower.That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of quality. Im not sure if this book was intended as a novel but if it was it failed to produce character growth. Its standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The authors ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.

The reviews Ive read are all true.  This book is boring extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that shes lost her editor because to me a good editor wouldnt let books like this be printed.This story pretty much follows stories shes done before except its told from the guys point of view.  Theres the rich guy Charlie who cant seem to find the perfect girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age his sister left school to raise him and just before he graduated college she died of a brain tumor.  So of course hes afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.Then theres rich Adam whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them his mother lets him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.The last of the trio is Gary a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlies yacht partying and going on and on about how they dont want commitments.  Well of course each one meets someone they start to date they argue they break up they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You cant tell me she doesnt have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books even a paperback and I wont even bother renting them from the library.

719,1410401723:the_gothic_aspects_did_not_work_for_me.:c._gilbert_frumiousb,1410401723,Flashback: Books: Nevada Barr,books,2,The Gothic aspects did not work for me.,November 23 2005,C. Gilbert frumiousb,Amsterdam the Netherlands,This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeons own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback on the other hand felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary. If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing but hope that it can be redeemed with a third.,1.0,1.0,Nevada Barr,second nevada barr have read picked up strength deep south which thought really terrific frustrating nearly all what liked about deep south missing flashbackflashback structured interwoven narratives which involve both reallife murder civil war mystery related anna pigeons own family civil war story told through letters dreamlike sequences clearly intended add note gothic mystery story some may like flavor element provides dilutes elements writing most enjoy really liked crisp realism deep south felt style put cut above most books genre flashback other hand felt painfully contrived plot line letters extremely unrealistic mind unnecessary if like historical mysteries gothic flavor more than like realism detective novel then probably significantly less bothered than flashback barr least made clear choice her approach book judging reviews not everyone had negative reaction interwoven plot linesi go ahead pick up third barr book because did like deep south so much disappointing have not had high hopes realized second outing hope can redeemed third

Well Ford certainly expends plenty of words but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories.

Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is but its a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something.

Western specialists who helped the Turks conduct their censes stated that the Turks purposely undercounted the Christians and overcounted the Turks.  So there were many more than just five million Christians.  There are now approximately only a hundred thousand Christians in Modern Turkey.  The question that the author pointedly neglects to address is what happened to the difference between over five million in the early 1900s and only a hundred thousand people today.  We know that over a million surviving Greeks were expelled in the exhange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923.  Again what happened to the huge difference of 4-5 million people?  To the 1.5 million massacred Armenians must be added three quarters to a million Assyriac Christians (Aramaic-speaking Arab Christians) and as many as two million Greeks (almost 30 percent of the Greek people).  The author does not touch on the large numbers of Christians who were enslaved by Turks or forced to convert to Islam to avoid massacre which explains the large number Greek-speaking Turks around Trebizon on the Black Sea.  It is not as if there is not vast contemporary accounts of neutral and Western observers of this enormous genocide and ethnic cleansing of the original pre-Turkish populations of Anatolia.  I can only conclude that the author had such an inborn bias in favor of Turkey as to ignore a slaugher that approaches the Jewish holocaust of WWII.  Avoiding this subject amounts to holocaust denial.  The Christian genocide was the first great genocide of the 20th century and Hitlers model for the Jewish genocide. The massacre of the Greek and Armenian population of Smyrna (now Izmir) ranks with the Rape of Nanking in sheer horror and scale but the,10.0,40.0,Caroline Finkel,official censes ottoman empire early 1900s showed well over five million christians living provinces what now modern turkey western specialists who helped turks conduct censes stated turks purposely undercounted christians overcounted turks so there many more than just five million christians there now approximately only hundred thousand christians modern turkey question author pointedly neglects address what happened difference between over five million early 1900s only hundred thousand people today know over million surviving greeks expelled exhange populations between greece turkey 1923 again what happened huge difference 45 million people 15 million massacred armenians must added three quarters million assyriac christians aramaicspeaking arab christians many two million greeks almost 30 percent greek people author does not touch large numbers christians who enslaved turks or forced convert islam avoid massacre which explains large number greekspeaking turks around trebizon black sea not if there not vast contemporary accounts neutral western observers enormous genocide ethnic cleansing original preturkish populations anatolia can only conclude author had such inborn bias favor turkey ignore slaugher approaches jewish holocaust wwii avoiding subject amounts holocaust denial christian genocide first great genocide 20th century hitlers model jewish genocide massacre greek armenian population smyrna now izmir ranks rape nanking sheer horror scale

Snyder Darkstalker,San Antonio TX USA,Karl Marx years ago gave a description of why this might be happening. He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value: an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make. NO ITS NOT!!! An objects worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers. To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things. Petty-bourgeois owners i.e. the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general of which my grandpa a dentist was a part of are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail. This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government. All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out. Theres a reason why the owners of Wal-Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8 as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt lay off employees and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart. Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marxs Labor Theory of Value once again) and of the use of emminent domain abuse (which can be justified on the grounds of the greater good as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores). But no theory is ever flawless and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and reality.

What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS Iran-Contra welfare deficits funding mujahideens cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler happy citizens...happily lived ever after. Basically this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers dont know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80s (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans.

The authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject but they fail to analyze the information they present.  The reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included.  The authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective.

Eddie is no Willy Loman though and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central driving force like Willy.  Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams and they dont seem to work in this context.  There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York and it is the only topic that is at all explored well if still unsatisfactorily.  Eddies dreams are represented in his pretty niece Catherine; and unlike Willy Lomans uncle she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddies life seem all the more petty in comparison to Willys: he longs wearily not after what he could have had but after what he can never have as he is already married.  The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced tacked on ending and Alfieris entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick.  There are better plays by Miller and many better plays by others,2.0,5.0,Arthur Miller,play explores same old turf death salesman does so much less satisfaction much less character development eddie no willy loman though play suffers immediately lack central driving force like willy parts play seem borrowed tennessee williams dont seem work context there some business about romance old world italy versus new world opportunity docks new york only topic all explored well if still unsatisfactorily eddies dreams represented his pretty niece catherine unlike willy lomans uncle she still attainable dream makes eddies life seem all more petty comparison willys longs wearily not after what could have had after what can never have already married death scene end play also seems like forced tacked ending alfieris entire presence more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick there better plays miller many better plays others

Bynum,Detroit MI  USA,Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the authors writing skills he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Pauls life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.  ,18.0,29.0,Paul Clemens,before purchasing made detroit read reader reviews reviews so mixed decided against buying book checked out library instead turns out made best decision all can say thank fellow reviewers book definitely not worth purchase price statement nothing do authors writing skills skilled writer everything do his lack insight paul clemens could live city have such skewed view downright scary read book waiting paul have revelation would help him put pieces his life together make peace them after 241 pages no more enlightened than page one blacks caricatures whose sole role life make pauls life hard women peripheral characters who barely given voice finds way put down demean everyone who not white male his book if white male who harbors secret racist feelings enjoy book validate feelings if anyone else reaction no doubt range mild boredom outrage read book felt sadness profound sense dismay had some worse fears confirmed there white folks who actually still think like hope light comes paul still young if does maybe share his insights us

Lewis,books,1,PAIN AS GODS MEGAPHONE,August 12 2006,Peter Payne,Peter Payne author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA:  A YOUNG MANS ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF,Since God is Infinite Goodness we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is Gods megaphone.  If some people such as the Jews try to love God without going through Christ it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God such as Job or C. S. Lewis for that matter cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored so He uses pain over and over again to plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls.    Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankinds painful existence an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous.  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses who identified God as righteous that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me?  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why or how I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course God is wiser than me so if I could only see it from Gods viewpoint I would see that the butchery of whole populations including babies and animals was actually ,2.0,13.0,C. S.

It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontzs recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in The Hideaway had almost identical deformities and personality) (2) devoted super-powered canine companions (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs and (4) evil bioethicists.The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter however does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils you are supposed to really really like her and fear for her safety.I dont know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics but he has a terribly misguided view of the field taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.The final issue is Koontzs near-deification of dogs particularly Golden Retrievers which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny ,,,Dean KoontzAnne Twomey,truly disappointing book starts incredibly slowly found very hard become interested plot another disappointment koontzs recycling elements other novels 1 plucky highly intelligent disabled girl young female protagonist hideaway had almost identical deformities personality 2 devoted superpowered canine companions 3 bad guys driving around ultra pimpedout rvs 4 evil bioethiciststhe leilani character patently ridiculous she conveniently genius iq does not make absurdly adult manner which she speaks any more believable found so disconcerting detract plot koontz clearly trouble writing children book no exception almost all children featured his books either autisticmr or genius wunderkinds latter however does not justify his habit making smart children talk like genius adults dean heaps hardships poor leilani all subtlety episode walker texas ranger case miss anvils supposed really really like her fear her safetyi dont know how or where dean koontz learned about bioethics terribly misguided view field taking extreme sect represent main viewpoint field further states multiple times eugenic bioethics principles being taught medical students major universities who have pay involvement evil bioethics medical student can assure patently untrue koontz could so offbase topic directly relates central motive disconcerting makes already weak book even harder swallowthe final issue koontzs neardeification dogs particularly golden retrievers which common motif his more recent works ridiculous unintentionally funny

Stevens Texas Pimpernel,Longview TX,I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her troops give is that it is through the use of thought transference which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters dont know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as we.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories ufo sightings satanic ritual abuse and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative artistic intelligent and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long boring anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.

The real story was out in the rest of the ship that weekend.

Not recommended.In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer Karl Shapiro said I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is . . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age and . . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet but I agree that it must. Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them either.Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Millers experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Millers stories about his friends are tedious pointless and catty; like Miller they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers as though believing is being. Miller writes A year ago six months ago I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it I am--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.When they are not creating or talking about philosophy or creating Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as woman when there are so many obscene demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid drunken irrational loose sly deceptive and good primarily for one function which Miller turns into a squalid cold joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the living no one seems to be having fun and some characters notably Fillmore find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.Miller expresses contempt for the machine the industrial age and money--although he schemes to keep 2800 francs from Fillmores mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket.,11.0,20.0,Henry Miller,tropic cancer henry miller not recommendedin his 1960 introduction tropic cancer karl shapiro said call henry miller greatest living author because think spiritual example stands among great men our age orwell predicts miller set pace attitude novelist future not happened yet agree must shapiro does not support any points his essay nothing about tropic cancer supports them eithertropic cancer consists 318 pages recounting millers experience american expatriate paris expounding his personal philosophy often ways rambling painfully nonsensical millers stories about his friends tedious pointless catty like miller seem have been talentless hacks whose belief own artistic abilities makes them artists writers though believing being miller writes year ago six months ago thought artist no longer think about amwhich type arrogant pretentiousness mocks virtually all his acquaintanceswhen not creating or talking about philosophy or creating miller his circle seem spend nearly every moment picking up women disease rarely use neutral term such woman when there so many obscene demeaning words which objectify gender women miller friends find invariably portrayed stupid drunken irrational loose sly deceptive good primarily one function which miller turns into squalid cold joyless act spite all vice living no one seems having fun some characters notably fillmore find themselves nearly trapped into bourgeoisie lifemiller expresses contempt machine industrial age moneyalthough schemes keep 2800 francs fillmores mistress revels having so much his pocket

When I picked up this book I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. The book starts out promisingly even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. Were given the account of Charles Monet one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on Preston gives a description of the virus what it does how it does it - the works. Then he moves on to the Human Component the cast of characters so to speak for the big story.The big story is alas not so impressive. Its a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about but nothing of the sort happens. Basically people run around in bio-hazard gear fret a lot and monkeys die. In between Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus cases of people being infected crashing and bleeding out cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys unless youre a PETA type.The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book which is a noble idea but not when they dont die at the end. Basically hes trying to make you care about these people and all for naught. And by the time that youre supposed to be truly concerned you actually WANT them to die because youre tired of hearing about him describe in active detail what they eat in the morning what they do in the afternoon and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When youre addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaaxs hands and karate prowess?

I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadnt paid more than $1 for it. While the title The Unprocessed Child accurately describes Lauries upbringing this book shouldnt be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter reminds me of the mother in Love You Forever who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown sons room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that shes not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them.

No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags. I found none no sound effects either no fireworks. At that point I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. Its only now that I can bring myself to review this mans book patriot that he is. I say this so you know what youre getting yourself into.

The very first Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book was published in 1950 (still available) revolutionized how cookbooks were produced and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the companys kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the companys bottom line but to the detriment of good cooking.  The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books treasure and keep it; youll never see their likes again.The current 10th edition looks good but like the past several editions the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the dump and stir method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly assuring conversationial voice of yesteryear.

The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be on to him every book?

However he doesnt seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either hes guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case considering how influential this book has become. Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.The real reason why this book with its overwhelmingly female readership has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that rises to the top for Christian singles.Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from Gods plan for their lives many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately this often gets boiled down to some kind of passive Christian guy thing but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage whether its New York City Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.

Lawrence,books,1,ruined by its ignorance of female sexuality,October 8 2005,A Reader,USA,I found this book embarrassing to read - not because its risque but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy let alone female sexuality. Its also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.Everything outside of sex is dumb meaningless ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the mental life makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrences own true and correct way makes one pathetic or defective or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of woman or man; and so on. Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on whats wrong with everyone except C. and M. one might easily conclude that Constance doesnt really seem happier now that shes sleeping with the gamekeeper and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing that kind of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that theres something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched because she does not have that one thing that in Lawrences view really matters in life - not Mellors but Mellors equipment.

And there was nothing but glowing accolades for the mob and its activities.  Furthermore anyone who opposed the mafia and its activities was labeled an extremist and in the text their names were never more than about 4 or 5 words away from words like Ku Klux Klan racist bigoted or paranoid youd begin to suspect that the book was a bit biased wouldnt you?Americas Uncivil Wars is a book written by Mark Lytle a professor at Bard College.  He documents events in American History in this book from the 1950s to about 1975.  Practically every time a genuine conservative individual or organization is mentioned in this book it is associated to a racist organization whenever Mr. Lytle doesnt add his own commentary.  For example on page 22 he says Joseph McCarthy revealed himself as a mean-spirited slob.  This is a far cry from the McCarthy I know the McCarthy who wrote the brilliant Americas Retreat from Victory for example.  And forget about anything good mentioned about the John Birch Society.  Page 138: Most Americans ignored the hooded Klansmen the John Birchers and other extremists...  never mind the fact that JBS is not and never was a racist or an extremist organization.  But here is their name sandwiched between the KKK and extremist.It is a typical tactic of the left to associate the opposition with the stench of racism as Stalin may have put it (I dont remember his exact quote).  But you might ask what about on page 89 where he refers glowingly to William F. Buckley as the cornerstone of the anti-communist wing of conservatism...?

Schwarz,books,3,Squeezing Spiritual Growth into a Business Box,April 14 2006,Concerned Small Church Leader,Worland Wyoming,This guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega-church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches.  Many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories.While the guide may be helpful in identifying strengths and weaknesses in your local congregation its theories for projecting future growth or your churchs demise are analyzed using European and Urban models and have limited insight into the unique dynamics of the Christian church in the varied regions of North America as a whole.  Most limiting in this perspective is the distinctly spiritual aspect of church growth which results in a gigantic disparity in trying to compare churches and businesses.  This is a manual for analyzing and strategizing for plotting and planning to stock more seats in the pews and makes no significant mention of the actual spiritual journey or genuine troubles and struggles of the very real person searching for belief.  The philosophies of this book graphically illustrates why some other Christian writers such as Eugene Peterson contend that too many pastors view the members of their churches as assets to be managed rather than human souls with questions concerns needs and priorities of their own.

Mullaney kightlinger,Atlanta Georgia USA,I found the book thought-provoking but there is more to philosophy than provocation. The common underlying argument of this book and its only valid statement as ethics is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in. This results-oriented approach is all very well but Singer doesnt really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument. Virtually all of Singers arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept. If you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument; if you dont accept the premise its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion. In short these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline. How useful you find this is up to you.

799,0553146688:the_south_rises_again_in_all_its_historically_inaccurate_glory:hope_e._marston,553146688,Confessions of Nat Turner: Books: William Styron,books,1,The South Rises Again in all its Historically Inaccurate Glory,April 21 2006,Hope E. Marston,Eugene OR,I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999 titled This is a racist book disguised as a work of art.  It seems that I didnt explain well enough my objection to Styrons co-opting of the story of a real human being Nat Turner whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book The Confessions of Nat Turner by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Grays book in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.  Unlike his depiction in Styrons book Nat Turner was married.  Styrons invention of Turners pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman Margaret Whitehead is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Grays account Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turners life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turners fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turners skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turners life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.

We dont even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after theyve already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I dont really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels but the plot in this one defies belief. Its never explained why the first murder even occurs. The heros fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because shes using the last name Jones is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together.

The style is somewhat pedantic and staid but easy to read. Its certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here.

Tolleson-Rinehart suetr,Chapel Hill NC USA,The book had so much promise but I find it to be disappointing in several ways alas.  The recipes Ive tried have been delicious and the instructions accompanying those recipes are fairly clear and authoritative although the discussions and instructions dont rise to the level of a cooking teaching tool as would for example anything by Julia Child Marcella Hazan Jacques Pepin or any of the King Arthur Flour baking cookbooks all of which really teach one new skills while providing wonderful recipes.  In this case I was already pretty experienced at making ice cream before I bought the book.  Were I a tyro I dont think this book would be the best introduction although of course there is nothing like plunging in and trying.My biggest disappointment though is the organization of the book:  ice cream recipes are bundled with their accompanying cookies garnishes and the like; instead of a group of recipes for chocolate ice cream for example we have a group of recipes for ice cream sandwiches with ice cream of any of several different flavor families.  One has to dig around in the index at the back of the book to find say recipes for chocolate ice cream.  I would much prefer to have an index or table of ice cream recipes by flavor and page number right up front -- I dont want to spend so much time looking for the flavor I want.  My next disappointment is that the text is printed in a graphically attractive and most stylish but virtually illegible size and color.  My middle-aged eyes struggle desperately to read the book even with my reading glasses on and I surely cant prop the book 18-20 back from my utensils to read as I work without changing position as I like to do with my cookbooks.

Lydick stevelydick,Grand Island NE United States,Ive used the lonely planet guides on other trips before and have always been very pleased but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased based on our previous experiences with them but we had the chance to peruse others in the B&Bs we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them Id rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination so upon reflection we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it but Id rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  Id still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  Thats quite a jump for 2 years indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.Our second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also and this may be a function of the 2003 printing a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers and LPs maps rarely identified this.  A third again related gripe is with the existance or lack thereof of the various restaurants b&bs shops etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just arent there any more.,13.0,13.0,Fionn DavenportCharlotte BeechTom DownsDes HanniganFran ParnellNeil Wilson,ive used lonely planet guides other trips before have always been very pleased one left different taste mouth lp only guide purchased based our previous experiences them had chance peruse others bbs stayed throughout our trip all them id rate lp 2nd best our interests say individual experiences may vary ireland become very expenive tourist destination so upon reflection would have been happier rough guide lp just tried hard cover all levels expense one guide ended up shortchanging all them process hate say id rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre best id still put above most other guidebooks thoughour first foremost gripe how out date price estimates everything realize published two years ago gradually learned depend everything costing about 20 more than lp listed thats quite jump 2 years indicating either poor factchecking 2003 edition or some pretty crazy inflation need another updateour second gripe local maps failed provide maps lot smaller cities only provided maps citycenter areas larger ones given rarity irish street signage maps would have been godsend navigation towns also may function 2003 printing lot towns ireland instituting oneway patterns citycenters lps maps rarely identified third again related gripe existance or lack thereof various restaurants bbs shops etc listed guide probably 30 restaurants guide just arent there any more

Heres an excerpt from the review which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdfMany fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them. It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information. The reviewer goes on to say:...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are. It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book that they should trash it.,28.0,28.0,Ngaire E.

Connell nicnsib,Pasadena CA United States,First I am a very open-minded person raised by a hippy/Biker family.  I really expected to identify with this book.  While I appreciate the what Ina Mays movement accomplished during its time I felt like the book was almost a joke--verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community--A community of people living on old school buses in the woods delivering each others babies.The language is terrible---everything is described as psychedelic etc--one woman even referred to her female parts using the big p word.  While they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe---NOBODY mentions feeling pain during labor. Honestly I feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they wouldnt have admitted to pain if they could.Also many of the accounts were extremely erotic---couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed.  In some accounts a couple would be making out while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her laboring parts--turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed.  Not my cup of tea.I had so little respect for the lifestyle and the language of the people that I didnt get much out of the book,3.0,14.0,Ina May Gaskin,first am very openminded person raised hippybiker family really expected identify book while appreciate what ina mays movement accomplished during time felt like book almost jokeverging more detailing accounts occult communitya community people living old school buses woods delivering each others babiesthe language terribleeverything described psychedelic etcone woman even referred her female parts using big p word while try add personal touch including individual narrations sounds more like compilation uneducated people describing birth stories way pressured believenobody mentions feeling pain during labor honestly feel pressure community so intense wouldnt have admitted pain if couldalso many accounts extremely eroticcouple encouraged fondle one another during labor keep connected relaxed some accounts couple would making out while midwife would massage birthing mother her laboring partsturning woman keeping her relaxed not cup teai had so little respect lifestyle language people didnt get much out book

The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a hell.  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  Hell was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and converting effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as orthodox centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Youngs Literal propagate this fallacy.Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.Other HIGHLY recommended books are The Inescapable Love of God by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312 not on Amazon you must google it) The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment by Thomas Thayer The Bible Hell by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what hell is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.

Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers?  After all Israel is kind of small.  Doesnt it need um a tiny bit more land?Well Israel may need a little more land.  But almost nobody is proposing anything like this.  I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank let alone all of Jordan.  And as for the Nile to the Euphrates this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda.  Theres a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail in case anyone cares.Yes weve seen propaganda before.  In the 1930s some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world.  Now what do we see in this book?What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.  Is there any connection between this and truth?Yes theres a connection.  You see in the Bible (in Deuteronomy) Moses says at one point that Israels borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the western sea (presumably the Mediterranean but definitely not the Nile).  Of course someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says.  It turns out that theres much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical.  And that specifies a much smaller Israel.  In addition it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders no matter how large or small to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today.  Hedges is doing us a big disservice here.

Based on true facts the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck who confessed that she never went and wasnt interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) cant even get the spanish names right: Mauel instead of Manuel Rosaria instead of Rosario; Iez instead o Ins.

832,0553293354:read_because_it_considered_a_classic:k._macdonald,553293354,Foundation (Foundation Novels (Paperback)): Books: Isaac Asimov,books,2,Read because it considered a classic,July 23 2006,K. MacDonald,Baltimore MD,The book is written about an empire in the future.  Im not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer which is a dying system of government instead of a democratic republic.  I know this is nit-picking but I didnt like this book.  Apparently the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician as I do knows that its difficult to predict whats going to happen in anyones life tomorrow much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship which is something I cant stand.  Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else so feel they should rule over everyone else if only you would listen to them.  This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  Another idea thats patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict with a high degree of accuracy the downfall of civilization and the rising of a new one along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through why wasnt he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  Surely with his predictive ability people would listen to him but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer.  The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.

Pirsig,books,1,The worst book supposedly about philosophy that I have EVER read,November 22 2006,J. Miller,nyc,Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of real child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his sons murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsigs son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something deep in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent,0.0,5.0,Robert M.

Thomas,Slippery Rock PA,The premise of the store is interesting.  How did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football?  The first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons.  (West Coast offense LT etc.)  Unfortunately at that point Lewis runs out of things to write about so he starts talking about Michael Oher an O Lineman at Ole Miss.  Ohers story is intersting but it is too early to tell.  He is a superstar but only a sophomore.  I also think that Lewis overdoes how great Oher already is.  I also dont really understand what Ohers story really had to do with the original premise of the book.  Is Lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions Oher wants to be one?  I would think that if Oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player.  Last time I checked lineman were big and strong (and quick) in that era too. ,,,Michael Lewis,premise store interesting how did left tackle become one most important positions football first half book does fair job walking through reasons west coast offense lt etc unfortunately point lewis runs out things write about so starts talking about michael oher o lineman ole miss ohers story intersting too early tell superstar only sophomore also think lewis overdoes how great oher already also dont really understand what ohers story really had do original premise book lewis saying because left tackles now make millions oher wants one would think if oher had come around 70s people would still have thought him football player last time checked lineman big strong quick era too

Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So Im not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.But!

It is as if the author could really care less. There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this womans life. There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. I found her less likable and also less believable. She has taken in her husbands mistress ad illegitimate child. Now there is a question about the childs paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!!

John Corey is still a funny memorable character.CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The authors use of a doomed characters point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villains Dr. Evil-esque plan (FIRE THE NUKE!). Then after we know everything we get plopped back into the first-person investigative head of Corey who doesnt yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.2. The dont-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and uh THE LIONS GAME. Why is Teds appearance so brief here? Well he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably Teds dead for good now. 3. The politics of DeMilles novels has been present in other books but its never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country. The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.  4. Continuity problems from how the last book NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep they are bothered by 9/11 but they are both working their same jobs apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the accident of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this but not much. Apparently a guy like Corey doesnt do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work.

First it spent too much time at least for me on the details of minor episodes and players.  In this sense I might have appreciated the treatment had I been a scholar researching the field - but I wasnt.  Hence I often found the reading dull.  Second I found Powers ultimate thesis - that Heisenberg purposefully delayed the German atomic bomb program - unpersuasive.  It appeared to me that Powers often strained his interpretation of the facts to make them conform to his thesis.  For example when reviewing Heisenbergs Farm Hall statement in August 1945 that two tons of U235 was required to make an atomic bomb Powers suggests that because Heisenberg articulated the appropriate lesser amount a week later  and because he purportedly suggested at an earlier date that a bomb could be the size of a football his two ton statement was a purposeful error. Equally persuasive if not more is the simple thought that Heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what was required thereby prompting him to tell Speer in 1942 that a bomb was impractical. This is not to say that Powers is necessarily wrong.  I simply believe that based on the facts he presents the issue remains debatable,5.0,9.0,Thomas Powers,while found book interesting informative when dwelled upon personalities contributions physicists who discovered explored field quantum mechanics prior ww2 found two problems book entered war first spent too much time least details minor episodes players sense might have appreciated treatment had been scholar researching field wasnt hence often found reading dull second found powers ultimate thesis heisenberg purposefully delayed german atomic bomb program unpersuasive appeared powers often strained his interpretation facts make them conform his thesis example when reviewing heisenbergs farm hall statement august 1945 two tons u235 required make atomic bomb powers suggests because heisenberg articulated appropriate lesser amount week later because purportedly suggested earlier date bomb could size football his two ton statement purposeful error equally persuasive if not more simple thought heisenberg did indeed grossly overestimate what required thereby prompting him tell speer 1942 bomb impractical not say powers necessarily wrong simply believe based facts presents issue remains debatable

Unfortunately the newer publication is less useful. It seems to have been written on a pretext that its clever to be able to duplicate what traditional artists can do. This seems - from my own personal viewpoint - to be greatly undervaluing the power of Photoshop (and similar software). Practitioners of digital fine art should (really constructively) be looking to explore what the principles of prior and traditional art can mean within a new domain.Plus the book gets off to a definitely poor start. The second and longer of two introductory sections is titled The Tricks of the Trade. Well it would be better if just some of the tricks had been explained in full and more accurately.  Say how to make a selection in Photoshop from the best available precursor (a black-and-white alpha channel). Or say again how to make tonal corrections to the original photograph using a luminance mask. Then again the first (and shorter) of the introductory chapters titled The Artists Eye is just a teaser. This topic - pre-visualizing what can be achieved as an output image when composing the original photographic input - could have benefited from a much more detailed explanation/argument. Indeed it could even merit an expansive concluding chapter (but the book doesnt have one of those at all ....). This is after all at the very core of what the user could harness to any given artistic objective.Additionally I think that its strange that a book such as this simply makes no reference at all to what could be printed from the recipes it contains.

However the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive Communist takeover in America came to pass coupled with his outspoken admiration for McCarthy and truly insane predictions like this:Once the takeover comes you like millions of others who believe in God and mans responsibility for his own actions can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the Red Army. p. 20have forced me to conclude that Stormers thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect. Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist. The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument. the sad thing is because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched it is far too dry to be amusing even when read ironically. and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda. in closing i would take Communism over John A.

Schneider,,I recently picked up a copy of Mage: The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect. Since Ars Magica Ive loved Mage. From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolfs editions of Mage: The Ascension finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today.Mage: The Ascension Revised was truly a delight featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games. A complexity that made working magic truly fun sure there were flaws without a good Storyteller you could easily abuse the open ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted... but it was a good price to pay for flexibility interesting possibilities and an all around great RP system.Is it fair to compare Mage: The Awakening with Mage: The Ascension Revised? Of course not the game has to be based on its own merits and flaws. The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP modern RP market. It also seems to be marketed toward a very specific audience.With the exception of some really interesting RP books (White Wolfs translation of Engel from the German a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly creative and Demon: The Fallen - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be creative) RP books are typically very bland and all the same. Mage: The Awakening is no different. Unfortunately it tries to blend easy mechanics with simple spells as though past Mage books have been too complicated (which they havent unless the new World of Darkness market is much younger than they previously were... which is a possibility or perhaps they arent interested in realistic depth so much as they are just having quick fun). There is absolutely nothing culturally significant about the Mage: The Awakening game system.

They did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best theyve ever been. One of the flaws of MAGE:Ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the Technocracy and the Traditions in a manner that reflected Vampire:Masquerades clan structure and Sabbat vs Camarilla. One of the flaws of Vampire:Masquerade was that it had this whole history of Caine as the first vampire and the Anti-Diluvians as the founders of the clans that overshadowed the game. In Mage:Ascension Mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been re-written by the technocracy so who really knew about the past?  In Awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from Vampire and put it into Mage with the creation of Atlantis and the Exarchs. The Societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting. The replacement of Avatars with Towers doesnt make sense to me. The eternal struggle theme remains with the Exarchs but seems a lot less important than the struggle over the consensus in Ascension. Awakening is chock full or rotes. For Mage in a LARP rotes are essential shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of table top and live action systems but detracts from the table top experience where Mages can do almost anything. They split the Entropy Sphere into Death and Fate which kind of makes sense except that Death has too much overlap with Spirit.  Im going to use the new Mechanics with the old world in my new campaign. The new Mage setting doesnt inspire me like the old one did.

Normally I would have donated the book ater reading it. But in this case I was so disappointed I threw the book away after reading it.  I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US.  I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee.  It seemed to me they found a story they liked and that is where their critical thinking ended. It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought.   After reading it it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa.  I am from western PA as is ODell and this book lacks local color.  She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale.  Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say aint slippy and youns. This would be esp. true for someone like the main character Harley. (There are people with college degrees from this area who still have color in their language.) Odell is no Faulkner or Caufield.

It is not even really about heartland the main part of the book is based in Occanumba. Also there are hardly any horses in this book just Maverick (who is only a minor part) and a tiny bit of Spindleberry and Albatross. It is mainly about Carey and her mood swings. It is also a bit unrealistic as Amy comes out eith long involved emotional speeches that no teenager i know would blab on about! The way she talks is more like a middle aged psychatrist! I also think that the most recent books have been targeted at a younger audience. At the start of the series i would class them as young adult material but now they are just for kids who like horses. She is supposed to be going out with Ty but they never seem to kiss much or do anything romantic. In this book he goes to Occanumba with Amy and they dont even get off together once! Even though they are in the forest all alone at one point with no adults around. All in all this book is ok but rather boring. Nothing much happens i thought Amy might at least have an arguement with Joni when she takes over with Spindleberry but no Amy has gone middle-aged and doesnt do anything. I would only recommend buying this book if you are a total heartland fan. Carey is really annoying at the start and the horses hardly feature at all.

Although she is more known in the U.S. for her mystery and espionage books her novel Under the Southern Cross is a bang-up great romance delivered in her typically spare (or is it stingy?) style. I was excited to see she had written another romance and not a mystery with a 10-second sex scene thrown in. But when I got to the last line of this book I found myself closing it and thinking that I had once again been suckered by past memories of Claire McNab. This book has a lot of promise to it -- therefore the two stars I gave it -- but its promise unfulfilled. There is a long setup of the writer Vonny Smith pining for the personal attention of her editor Diana. But why exactly is she in love with Diana? Darn if I know. The writing has great humor and spoofs the whole genre of romance novels. But the entire novel is a setup and in the end there is no delivery. Its annoying frustrating and feels like a cheat.

Thats a good theme.  However the author cant leave well enough alone.  He really goes after people without kids as though they all regardless of their circumstances remind him of his former self:  someone with too much cynicism and cowardice to raise a family even though thats obviously the only way to become a complete person.  Each chapter introduces a family and a crisis.  The people who range from southern Americans to Turkish Muslims to Protestant Irish in Belfast are terrific.  But the author goes off the deep end on page 47:  Now there are cities full of professional women and men who wholeheartedly echo this feeling [not wanting children].  They go around saying things like Im too selfish to be a mother or Im not a baby person or my favorite I love my life too much to do that to it.  A friend of mine calls them the Petrified Forest - people who would freeze their life in time if they could.  Manhattans turning into a Petrified Forest my friend mocked.  I [Bronson] winced when she said this because I used to be one of them.  When the Petrified Forest imagines parenthood their hearts are flooded with the feeling of doors closing not opening ... In our society today parenthood is on trial.  Well hardly.  Bronson is making a lot of assumptions about childless people.  Everyone doesnt need to have a baby just because Bronson found it a refreshing alternative to preserving his immaturity.  Im all for individuals pursuing the particular life that makes them happy but they should never push their specific solution upon the rest of us.

Ive found a large number of inconsistencies with history that should be obvious to anyone who has read this thing closely. For example on page 7 Coleman says the Club of Rome was established in 1968 but on page 17 he suggests that the Club of Rome played a key role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and attempted to sell its crisis management...progam to President Kennedy.  Unless weve been misled the Cuban Missile Crisis happened a full 6 years before this group was founded.  What are careful readers to make of such a passage? Either its a typo and he means 1958 or as I heartily suspect he doesnt have a grasp on his subject.  On page 9 Coleman suggests Henry Kissingers role in destabilizing the United States by three wars the Middle East Korea and Vietnam is well known... However Kissinger working at Harvard from 1948 had no role in the U.S. government until the 1960s working for the Kennedy Administration.  The Korean War as we are all aware occured in 1950 and ended long before Kissinger had any influence on American foreign policy.  If it were true that Kissinger had an influence on the United States policy in Korea for example then Coleman would be wise to address that issue at this point in his text. However he only leaves us with the cryptic is well known. It is definitely NOT well known and Coleman is just fooling those readers who think that a book which is difficult to read or which is discussing difficult subjects must be true. These are just a few of the inconsistencies that I could check in a short time that Coleman throws out at you.

SAXON,,It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrells reasoning but to make a few points:1. He implies that female circumcision is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? Its for protection? What or whose interests are being protected? 2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?3. The male instinct to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed instinct to protect. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs? 4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again the sacred testosterone drives this not women. 5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females dont know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.6.

Im reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here and from descriptions from my own mother I believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty-train me. I am 99% sure but she does not remember the title so I cant be 100% sure. My mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training. She got everyone else out of the house and removed all my toys from eyesight. Then she went through a detailed explanation using a potty doll and had me try to explain it back using the doll. She then showed me what looked like a whole kitchen full of little toys and candy and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day. I remember all that part. After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go potty all day. I was definately old enough to be doing this because I actually remember it. (I am 25 now so if this book was published in the late 70s or early 80s Im being accurate.) Now let me tell you the results. I dont remember how I felt that day but I do know that it started something that became a huge emotional battle for me. I was a very sensitive child and I am a very sensitive adult. What mom and I remember was that potty-training became a war in our home- and it took YEARS. Because of my sensitivities and my mothers poor choice in training methods I began holding my bowel movements. (I was able urinate in the potty at a normal age not sure when.) I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go even if she put me back in a diaper. I held for weeks at times and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me (obviously). When it finally got to the point that I couldnt hold it anymore the BM was so big that I needed physical help to go.

Feng gary,durham nc,You can tell I dont pay attention to Wall Street Journal or New York Times. I picked up David Sacks book from Borders Linguistics stack because of the title. I should have known better. I started the first chapter and didnt have the time or intention to finish it. The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks in my opinion systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not). Even within the first 20 pages or so I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims utter misinformation and distastefully Euro/English-centric. Here are some examples:The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt Mesopotamia and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found before or since (p.1) -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables. The spreadability of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. (p. 10) -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets such as Swahili Serbo-Croatian Urdu/Hindi and Yiddish. And then came this proud comment on the prospect our Roman letters. Immediately following the above quote he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstans decision to switch to Roman as well as other struggling nations likewise decisions to switch to Roman letters for native tongues as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English.

Henning,,My brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my Dads side of the family.  He had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on Accutane.  Having heard bad things about the side effects my Dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication.  He faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever.  Some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne I can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous.  When I was a teenager Id go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible and I got through high school with only the occasional zit.  Ive read that for a small number of people diet can be a factor for acne but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause (this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition isnt sexy).  Since medication should always be a last resort a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere.  For the curious while my brother had some strong side effects from the Accutane (none dangerous primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes) it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin,9.0,16.0,Nicholas Perricone,brother had severe acne year or so ago inherited dads side family had tried antibiotics no success wanted go accutane having heard bad things about side effects dad wanted brother try diet couple months before deciding take medication faithfully followed no results whatsoever some ideas book absurd diabetic horrible eating habit no teenage acne can tell focus dieting insulin spikes direct cause condition preposterous when teenager id go serious candy binges required insulin doses bordering irresponsible got through high school only occasional zit ive read small number people diet can factor acne obviously our experience points something else primary cause assumes eat reasonably well malnutrition isnt sexy since medication should always last resort change diet probably good first approach minor blemishes serious condition should look elsewhere curious while brother had some strong side effects accutane none dangerous primarily incredibly dry skin eyes certainly succeeded clearing up his skin

J. McCabe,,First a little background... Im 53 with a preteen son. Im not quite a Luddite.  I make my living from an online business that I own and operate. Our big present to our son last Xmas was a computer -- one he and I were going to build from scratch. The main use of the computer was going to be video games and school work. We gave our son a budget (not big by gamer PC standards) to shop for the parts. Ive read a few books recently on the gaming culture to better understand it. This book came highly recommended from reviews here so I read it.My reaction to the book? It took a while but I finally realized it felt like I was reading a study paid for and prepared on behalf of the video game industry. There are lots of great statistics but rather flimsy rational defending extensive video game playing and how its successfully preparing gamers to succeed in the future.  I did learn a few things. I got a dose of reality about why it seems like everyone under 35 plays video games extensively. I see that the *gamer generation* has a lot to offer. I also seriously wonder about the gaps in what they have to offer.A main thesis of the book is that gamers learn how to think and figure things out because video games are about figuring out how to beat the game. Interesting since by the examples cited it mostly appears to be trial and error with no significant logic involved. I call it learn by trying anything as opposed to learn by thinking. Both have their place.Supposedly gamers are more willing to take (theoretically controlled) risks as well. Somehow the authors see the dot.com boom (and bust) as an endorsement of the future of business in the hands of gamers (who largely ran the dot.coms). I see a different story than the authors from those days of yore.I could go on but I think you get the point. The book says little (nothing?) about how video games are helping gamers learn math science or reading. Personally I believe those ,10.0,16.0,John C.

Consider as one example the books Do Not Use warning regarding the prescription drug Armour Thyroid. Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISNT any research) the guide instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. If this is the sort of unbiased information you want about the drugs you take you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets.

He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups to include pretribulationists.  Indeed his scholarship is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship get Tim Cohens materials (see below):Tim LaHaye Jerry Jenkins and others in the Pre-Trib circle such as Ed Hindson Tommy Ice Chuck Missler Zola Levitt Thomas McCall John Hagee Grant Jeffrey Marlin Maddox Perry Stone Texe Marrs John Walvoord (deceased) etc. continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen in his excellent book The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.

No one has had the same negative impact on Roosevelts name to equal Wymans attack.  But although Wyman a  professional historian has well-documented his research much of the  indictment of the Roosevelt Administration is based upon conjecture  incapable of proof.  The litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of  Auschwitz.  He asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of  caring.  Thousands of Jews could have been saved.  But there is no way to  prove this.  Many Jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate  and Jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria.  Too much in his  charges is based on too little evidence.  Peter Novick in his book The  Holocaust in American Life calls Wymans thesis a &quot;comfortable  morality tale&quot; and &quot;bad history.&quot;  In addition to Novick  Henry L. Feingold Frank W.

Adams elusive and devastatingly beautiful is not only an accomplished seductress but also a lesbian.* * *I have just finished reading this book after struggling with it for two months and quite frankly it is probably the worst book I have ever taken the time to finish. The only reason I prevailed to the bitter end was I wanted to see if it truly was as bad to the last page as it was from the first--and let me tell you it was.Not only was this slow-paced stilted plodding excuse for suspence peppered with paper-thin characters who all sounded vaguely familiar but two of the three main protagonists are thinly disguised Xeroxes of two beloved TV characters minus the breast-plate sword and loin-cloth skirt. I leave you to work out who Im refering too.This book desperately struggles with flat stilted language that has neither voice nor colour giving the descriptions of place and people about as much life as a body on the morgue slab awaiting autopsy. Add to that is the fact that at least 50-60 pages could easily have been cut from the length by a good Editor thereby maybe adding a smidgen of tension to the over-worked plotline.However it is the three main protagonists who irritated me the most the Author seemingly unable to decide on personality traits and character which vacillate in a jarring way.

I have absolutely NO USE for it. Why?     Why pay money for a book that simply takes prepackaged cookie and cake mixes and adds a handful of nuts or dried fruit (thus making it homemade) to give away? Anyone with the smallest amount of natural creativity could do this on their own without the instruction of a cookbook. Let me give you an example: One of the recipes in this book is for lollipops. You melt down other lollipops or pieces of hard candy and drop a stick in the puddle. WOW. That is CRAFTY. How ridiculous. Even worse - as you will see by the illustration - the homemade lollipop looks disgusting. The stick is about four times as thick as the paper-thin puddle of liquified old hard candy. I wouldnt DARE give such a thing away as a GIFT.    Only a handful of recipes in this book are actually scratch-made from ingredients. The premise of this book is dressing up premade prepackaged foods from your local grocery store and slapping some notions from the craft store on a glass jar or paper box. While some of the presentation ideas are original and attractive in general it will prove a grave disappointment to an experienced cook.    I have given this book two stars because it does present lovely photo illustrations of every recipe and may give you inspiration for packaging and presenting your best recipes as gifts...... but if you have any creative talent and cooking skill whatsoever - I advise you to seek out another book on this subject. It is not worth the cost of the book.    Should you be interested in the simplicity and economical value (the craft notions to dress the package will cost more than the food you are preparing)found in this book - PLEASE- buy a USED copy - it isnt worth more than $3 bucks.

My life is great. ,October 3 2005,Aco,,This is not very good. That is to say the writing and the fluidity of Gazzaras life become bland and uninteresting quite fast. I initially picked it up because as an actor I find biographies or autobios about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like Paul Newman or Brando who each have several books...And Gazzaras career has been an intruiging one. As a member of the Actors Studio which produced the aforementioned actors along with countless others his rise to Broadway and Hollywood was quick. He originated Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and played his first film for Otto Preminger-opposite James Stewart and George C. Scott among others-in Anatomy of a Murder. But his approach to acting which is of primary importance to me was not chronicled. Instead he regales with stories of what and who the people he worked with were like. What the particular country he was shooting in was like etc. etc. One of his primary sources of regard is his work with John Cassavetes and it is clear Cassavetes was a major influence and close friend someone Gazzara owes much and the process by which they created Husbands and other films is investigated more than any other. Cassavetes too comes out as a more interesting Larger Than Life guy while Gazzaras tales of living in Italy or being in Spain New York Hollywood the Philippines etc. etc. just made me jealous... I guess I wanted to know more about the life of an Actor who has worked as long as Gazzara has is still relatively known-but never became a star and continues to work without feeling he is a hack who doesnt take his work seriously..,,,Ben Gazzara,not very good say writing fluidity gazzaras life become bland uninteresting quite fast initially picked up because actor find biographies or autobios about somewhat lesser known people more curious than approaching someone like paul newman or brando who each have several booksand gazzaras career been intruiging one member actors studio which produced aforementioned actors along countless others his rise broadway hollywood quick originated brick cat hot tin roof played his first film otto premingeropposite james stewart george c scott among othersin anatomy murder his approach acting which primary importance not chronicled instead regales stories what who people worked like what particular country shooting like etc etc one his primary sources regard his work john cassavetes clear cassavetes major influence close friend someone gazzara owes much process which created husbands other films investigated more than any other cassavetes too comes out more interesting larger than life guy while gazzaras tales living italy or being spain new york hollywood philippines etc etc just made jealous guess wanted know more about life actor who worked long gazzara still relatively knownbut never became star continues work without feeling hack who doesnt take his work seriously

This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read. The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist.

The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations.

After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.I would strongly recommend this book,0.0,1.0,Michael Crichton,sphere michael crichton excellant novel certainly hardest put down all crichton novels have read story revolves around man named norman johnson johnson phycologist travels 4 other civilans remote location pacific ocean help navy top secret misssion quickly learn under ocean half mile long spaceship civilans travel center 1000 feet under ocean live while researching spacecraft joined 5 navy personel help them run operations however surface typhoon comes support ships surface must leave team ten stuck 1000 feet under surface ocean after day under sea find out spacecraft actually american ship explored black holes brought back some strange things back earththis novel does not have research some other crichton novels have still lot information random things lawes partial pressure behavior analysisi would strongly recommend book

Goonan www.meaningful-life.us,Pleasanton CA,This is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length. I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful engaging and thought provoking story.This book packs the punch of great fiction. It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic. You certainly dont need to be a history major biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author.Jared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations. I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesnt give enough credit to social factors and their role is history.If you dont know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture the need for armies etc. You will find this fascinating reading.

973,0966562003:a_good_book.:boz,966562003,Worlds Fairs and the End of Progress: An Insiders View: Books: Alfred Heller,books,4,A good book.,June 22 2004,Boz,In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion which resembled a large refrigerator!,Since I am a Worlds Fair fanatic I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. In general this is an interesting and well researched book. The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. However I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be 80 feet talljust 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower. Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tallthe New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels Worlds Fair of 1958 was a largesquatround concrete block structure. It was indeed large and round but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone the architect of the pavilionthe outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. I have seen photos of the US Pavilion and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion which resembled a large refrigerator!) Thirdly the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. They had a large pavilion at the New York Worlds Fair of 1939. All in all however I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of Worlds Fairs,5.0,6.0,Alfred Heller,since am worlds fair fanatic have read almost everything can subject general interesting well researched book author apparently attended most expositions writes about however must point up three rather glaring errors book describing louisiana world expo 1984 states unbuilt symbol tower supposed 80 feet talljust 150 feet shorter than eiffel tower since eiffel tower actually over 900 feet tallthe new orleans fair tower would have had have been least 800 feet tallthis may have been typo which author did not catch timethe other error states us pavilion brussels worlds fair 1958 largesquatround concrete block structure indeed large round not squat not made concrete blocksaccording excellent book about edward durrell stone architect pavilionthe outer walls consisted large aluminum panels which latticed intricate designs so interior would flooded natural light have seen photos us pavilion seems beautiful airy structure comparison soviet pavilion which resembled large refrigerator thirdly spokane expo 1974 not first time ussr exhibited us expo had large pavilion new york worlds fair 1939 all all however would recommend book anyone who interested history worlds fairs

The step by step approach and the logical arrangement of chapters makes it a book that really teaches you photography. I also liked the way Mr. Frost uses two photographs to illustrate a filter. One take without the filter and then the same one with a filter.  Also explained very well is how longer lenses reduce depth of the photograph and small helful tips on increasing your depth of field.  An encompassing book the last few chapters tell about how a slide show can be made more interesting and how to take care of your equipment.  The peppering of photos and illustrations make you want to go out and take pictures using the methods shown. A good buy and money well spent.

His &quot;Great Work of Time&quot; is an intriguing Rashomon-esque time travel fantasy about Cecil Rhodes and British economic imperialism in East Africa at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It was almost as compelling a read as the &quot;The Nightingale Sings At Night&quot; which offers a fantastical twist on the Adam and Eve creation myth saga. The other two tales &quot;In Blue&quot; and &quot;Novelty&quot; I found much less compelling but they are redeemed by the same lyrical prose Crowley uses in other tales.

Rems lonelyzephyr83,Philadelphia PA,I found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer.  I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of by an author Ive never heard of and buy it on a whim.  This is the novel I bought last year.  I has unfortunately sat on my shelf since then until tonight because of many reasons.  Tonight however I picked it up and read it cover to cover.  The narrative was brilliantly told the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching.  If I had made it to the end without some tears I would believe myself made of stone!  Skip is a character many can relate to: a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out down about how his friends have really not been friends at all that gets the chance to do something great by this little child.  However it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title.  Faith a name not used lightly restores her namesake in all those touched by her.  She ultimately gives him the chance  of making something of his life without even knowing it.  Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times but also proud at how humankind can be at others (which is a fact in itself that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale).  The fact is that just because a person has been to jail has deadbeat friends does not mean he is of that same stock; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her.

The book is the story of Billy Parham a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his fathers cattle but realizes he cant kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams where everyone moves as if the air was liquid where every ruin has an irretrievable story where soot and heat and danger hang in the air and where nothing ever goes as planned. The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor All the Pretty Horses but thats not necessarily a shortcoming.   The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south east and west across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing Ive ever read ever and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth. This is a book that needs to be read.  Pick it up and let it seep into your skin let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world and to the West and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.   This is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just cant put into words.  But here somehow Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible but tangible.

This book does involve a lot of research and up-to-date theories for 1969 but is a little dated today.

996,0811213463:the_struggle_of_faith_and_duty:pung_yai,811213463,The Samurai (New Directions Classics): Books: Shusaku EndoVan C. Gessel,books,5,The Struggle of Faith and Duty,April 1 2005,Pung Yai,The Butt-End of the Cosmos,This was the first novel I read from Endo and I have to confess to being hooked on it from the first. It is both interesting from a historical perspective taking in an event that was singularly fascinating and deeply profound from a psychological perspective. It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.Hasekura is a deep character and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekuras thoughts. This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome. The possibility of faith in this pathetic man and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekuras desires dreams and simple wishes. The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.A notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco whose ambition seems to know no limits. His own struggles with ambition and the self-justifications that he employs are a lesson worthy of remembering. This novel is a great one and I was hooked to the very last page. It will take you into the world of Hasekura Velasco and their companions as they themselves see it. It will take you into their dreams their hopes their fatalism their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation. I totally unreservedly recommend this novel.

I could not put this book down... I am in my upper twenties and I am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already. Yes the book is bios about natural progesterone so what... I have not personally used progesterone cream yet because I am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure thats what I need. But even if I dont everything else provided in the book is amazing information. Your diet your vitamins your stress level your physical activity everything is co-related to most womans hormonal imbalances. They even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life she achieved hormone balancing. If you are suffering from hormonal imbalances I will strongly recommend this book. I also bought other ones that I will be reading after this one. But I started with Be Lean by Romy Seleznov which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did then I continued with this book and the next one I will be reading is Natural Hormone Balance for Women by Uzzi Reiss which does cite this book as well. If you think you have a hormonal imbalance please do not rely on your doctor 100% I am not saying that you should not believe them or rule out everything they say but do your homework. I have been telling my doctors since I am in my TEENS that I feel I have an imbalance with my hormones and since all of the results come back fine they have been telling me that my symptoms were normal... WRONG!!! Now they found a tumor in my pituitary gland which causes an imbalance... The tumor grows slowly so I am sure that it has been there for years but they never checked it before.

However this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares. Some people may not appreciate Dave McKeans artwork as much as they should because it is so different at least to those not familiar with the Sandman graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman in which Dave McKean did the cover art for all the books. At first glance the layout might seem confusing even distracting yet it somehow works here. Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy who suspects something is not right with her home. And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear the rest of her family do not...until its too late. The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end though perhaps it is not. You be the judge. This is a worthy book to read to third-graders and above though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern.

Its a gorgeous story and not cliched at all. What totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time I have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20s. She most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end. For example on page 233 And if all the gifts of Life are good perhaps too are all the shapes she chooses to take and which we cannot alter. The book is filled with hints at the time period even though after looking at countless reviews the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that Lud-in-the-Mist did not and it was a fantastical piece of literature. In my opinion this book was TOTALLY based on the time period. Theres even a line by the blacksmith about how since hes not white anymore he has come down in the world.

They also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen.

1010,0027085201:wonderful_wizard_of_oz:general_breadbasket,27085201,Wizard of Oz: Books: L. Frank Baum,books,5,Wonderful Wizard of Oz,September 19 2006,General Breadbasket,Melbourne Australia,I was a reasonably big fan of the Wizard of Oz when I was a kid. Id seen the Judy Garland film the Return to Oz film my parents had taken me to a theatre production and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia though you dont see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story and I really liked it. Its really a shame I couldnt find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a cyclone Dorothy her dog Toto and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures good and bad witches and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home and on the way makes many new friends like the Scarecrow Tin Woodsman and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?Its rather different to the movie I found. For one the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book like the queen of the mice the Hammerheads and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too I thought. Its very cosy and familiar and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain if that makes any sense. North south east west... in Ozs every direction theres a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet or how theyll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz.

1012,1564762424:helpful_as_a_backdrop_before_reading_pauls_epistles:john_wicklund,1564762424,The Apostle: A Life of Paul: Books: John Pollock,books,5,Helpful as a Backdrop Before Reading Pauls Epistles,September 7 2005,John Wicklund,Twin Cities MN United States,We know some things about Saul of Tarsus (later named the Apostle Paul) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information. Most everything we know from Paul is from the Dr. Luke in the Book of Acts or Pauls epistles themselves.  II Peter Chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements.  Peter in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom validates Pauls apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them. Pollocks book is presented as documentary-style reading since Pauls complete biography is not entirely clear.  There is much the author states is inference or speculation. If you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy I think this is an excellent book.One example of fuzzy facts that Pollock considers is the age-old controversy over the authorship of the Book of Hebrews.  The author of Hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it.  Pollock speculates that Paul while imprisioned in Acts Ch. 24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach.  With his imprisonment and his controversial style among the Jews he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his Jewish brothers.  Eternity will reveal who wrote the Book of Hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory.Overall the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding Paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed.,6.0,6.0,John Pollock,know some things about saul tarsus later named apostle paul complete biography always lacking because sketchy incomplete information most everything know paul dr luke book acts or pauls epistles themselves ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements peter some his last earthly words before martyrdom validates pauls apostleship states some his writings teachings difficult should follow them pollocks book presented documentarystyle reading since pauls complete biography not entirely clear there much author states inference or speculation if can respect not build doctrine facts where evidence fuzzy think excellent bookone example fuzzy facts pollock considers ageold controversy over authorship book hebrews author hebrews does not identify himself scholars argue who wrote pollock speculates paul while imprisioned acts ch 24 two years may have had time motivation write book people so desparately wanted reach his imprisonment his controversial style among jews may have left his identity anonymous so himself would not stumbling block reach his jewish brothers eternity reveal who wrote book hebrews certainly plausible theoryoverall greatest benefit reading book provide better framework understanding paul travels among early churches wrote letters them correcting various false teachings problems developed

1014,0679749004:finally_a_roth_novel_i_like!:jr_pinto,679749004,The Professor of Desire: Books: Philip Roth,books,4,Finally a Roth novel I like!,August 2 2005,JR Pinto,New Jersey,This is the first novel by Philip Roth that I actually like.  Portnoys Complaint was a good hundred-page novella spread out over a three-hundred page book; the other pages were filled with the dross of his political opinions and his kvetching about his parents.  Operation Shylock was also too pre-occupied with pushing a political agenda (but just what agenda we are never sure).  This is Roths primary fault as an author - he is too didactic.  I find that I really dont care much about what Roths political opinions are.  Ironically this is probably one of the attributes that make him a critical darling - it shows that he thinks deep thoughts.The Professor of Desire is blessedly free of politics.  In it Roth sticks with the subjects he knows best: sex and relationships.  Young David Kepesh is a sexually frustrated young student.  That changes while studying abroad in Swinging London where he finds that what they say about Swedish girls is true.  Things take a turn for the worse after the end of his disastrous marriage finds him crushed by loneliness in New York.  With the help of a psychiatrist Kepesh tries to discover if he will ever be able to commit to anyone or experience happiness.The Professor of Desire finds Roth at a more mature place in his career.  Gone is the odious kvetching about his parents that polluted so much of Portnoys Complaint; the parents in this book are treated with sympathy.  At one point a character points out to Kepesh that there is no point in mining the workings of a Jewish family for his fiction anymore.  He is also less homophobic in this novel - but not much so.  There are still things about Roths style that take getting used to; I dont think theres anything profound in his refusal to offset dialogue into separate paragraphs - it just makes it harder to keep track of who is speaking.  However The Professor of Desire is a short lyrical novel that is the best of anything Ive read of his so far.,6.0,6.0,Philip Roth,first novel philip roth actually like portnoys complaint good hundredpage novella spread out over threehundred page book other pages filled dross his political opinions his kvetching about his parents operation shylock also too preoccupied pushing political agenda just what agenda never sure roths primary fault author too didactic find really dont care much about what roths political opinions ironically probably one attributes make him critical darling shows thinks deep thoughtsthe professor desire blessedly free politics roth sticks subjects knows best sex relationships young david kepesh sexually frustrated young student changes while studying abroad swinging london where finds what say about swedish girls true things take turn worse after end his disastrous marriage finds him crushed loneliness new york help psychiatrist kepesh tries discover if ever able commit anyone or experience happinessthe professor desire finds roth more mature place his career gone odious kvetching about his parents polluted so much portnoys complaint parents book treated sympathy one point character points out kepesh there no point mining workings jewish family his fiction anymore also less homophobic novel not much so there still things about roths style take getting used dont think theres anything profound his refusal offset dialogue into separate paragraphs just makes harder keep track who speaking however professor desire short lyrical novel best anything ive read his so far

Bush.  We are confronted with a long term fight against Islamic nihilists.  The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.  Indeed if the Democratic Party returns to power the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.  Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.  And yes we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.  But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?  These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.  Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.  In their heart of hearts they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be purified.  The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.  Hopefully he starts to do so real soon before its too late.The crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.  A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.  We cannot however forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.  They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.  Lets get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.  But arent these individuals breaking the law?

Anderson,Huntsville AL USA,This book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row at least in the state of Mississippi and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences.  It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty.  However some sympathy is found for the victims of crime.  The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime.  Sams grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row. The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution.  Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prisons chaplain.I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books.,,,John GrishamMichael Beck,book not only interesting gives great deal insight into life death row least state mississippi appeals process involved stays execution commutation sentences touches activities ku klux klan impression author leans toward who favor abolition death penalty however some sympathy found victims crime story centers sam cayhall who sentenced death after several trials over number years following crime sams grandson becomes his attorney during last months appeal death row latter part book leaves one wondering whether or not there execution meanwhile sam shows repentance response prisons chaplaini found one better john grisham books

It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days and adapted for use thereThis book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked. Of course Laura didnt include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day. It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures.I found this book so lovely to read through not just browse through. The interest factor is great - learning what things were available and how they were used - baking soda yeasts how the oven was used what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble. But it is good as a simple recipe book.

While reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership they put together an excellent framework for leadership. The summary checklist given on pp. 171ff. offer a helpful concise summary of the book. The glaring omission and one that I cant believe that Hybels would make is to clearly point out that following Jesus style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus in other words you cant lead like Jesus if you dont have him in your life to help you. I cant believe that there wasnt at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further.

1026,048628512X:johnsons_classic_novel_of_passing:robin_friedman,048628512X,The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (Dover Thrift Editions): Books: James Weldon Johnson,books,5,Johnsons Classic Novel of Passing,April 12 2005,Robin Friedman,Washington D.C. United States,Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of passing. These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can pass for white.  Among other things novels based on a theme of passing allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of passing.  The earliest novel involving passing of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book An Imperative Duty which dealt with an inter-racial marriage.  The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled Passing set in the Harlem Renaissance.  More recently Philip Roths novel The Human Stain involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnsons only novel The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man written in 1912.  The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual like Roths character Coleman Silk with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an apparently white person and his strong sense of black identity.  Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of passing Johnsons protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnsons short novel is to my mind the best written on the theme of passing and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously.  The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914.  Many years later ,7.0,7.0,James Weldon Johnson,many novels africanamerican experience united states use theme passing novels generally involve lightcomplexioned africanamerican who can pass white among other things novels based theme passing allow character author comment upon blackwhite relationships united states both sides black experience white experienceboth white black authors have made extensive use theme passing earliest novel involving passing which am aware william dean howells his short 1891 book imperative duty which dealt interracial marriage africanamerican novelist nella larsen wrote novel titled passing set harlem renaissance more recently philip roths novel human stain involves story professor coleman silk distinguished academic student classics who passes many years whitecoleman silk successor protagonist james weldon johnsons only novel autobiography excolored man written 1912 unnamed protagonist book individual like roths character coleman silk great intellectual artistic gifts who torn between opportunities open him apparently white person his strong sense black identity like coleman silk characters most novels involving theme passing johnsons protagonist marries white woman lives life plagued guilt regarding his abandonment his heritage africanamerican johnsons short novel mind best written theme passing fine novel indeed book initially published anonymously writing so powerful believable many readers took book true autobiography until johnson acknowledged his authorship 1914 many years later

Cloyce Smith rabid bookfiend,New York NY United States,You the reader are the subject and the hero of Calvinos novel an exercise in reader-response theory gone mad. Calvinos lively experiment begins by describing a reader (that is you) reading Calvinos novel and after this opening you settle in to read the novel that you were meant to be reading--a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter. But all is not fair in the Land of Fiction; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book--only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely. After several tricks and machinations you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books written in ten different styles yet all sharing place and character names and even themes. (Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated: the most obvious segments mock Borges Dostoevsky and Chekhov.)  While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and you see the story through her eyes. Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you. The book alternates between the story fragments and the story of you. The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling: You cant get your bearings: the characters have changed the settings you dont understand what its about you find names of people and dont know who they are. Its a bit like Groundhog Day except that instead of being stuck inside the same day youre doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus. Well before the end of the novel you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies (mysteries fantasies and romances) that you desperately try (and fail) to finish but in the story of your reading experience itself--an experience,5.0,6.0,Italo Calvino,reader subject hero calvinos novel exercise readerresponse theory gone mad calvinos lively experiment begins describing reader reading calvinos novel after opening settle read novel meant readinga noir mystery cliffhanger end first chapter all not fair land fiction copy book been misbound printer so have rush store get properly printed bookonly find replacement different book entirely after several tricks machinations end up reading beginnings ten different books written ten different styles yet all sharing place character names even themes part fun identifying author being imitated most obvious segments mock borges dostoevsky chekhov while initially seems calvino assumes male soon introduced other reader see story through her eyes both work solve mystery erratic book passages pleasure reading heightened romantic tensions between two book alternates between story fragments story repeated changes interruptions style story can baffling cant get bearings characters have changed settings dont understand what about find names people dont know who bit like groundhog day except instead being stuck inside same day youre doomed repeat ten different terrifyingly similar acts literature interruptus well before end novel realize real story not found any parodies mysteries fantasies romances desperately try fail finish story reading experience itselfan experience

I share the Booklist reviewers sentiment that Sandford has produced a D.C. intrigue reminiscent of Ross Thomas (a VERY good thing!).  My biggest beef with Dead Watch is the bland characterization of Jake Winter (though Sandford does do a good job of making Winter not be Lucas Davenport); nearly every other character has more personality-pizzazz.  Not to worry though the Madison Bowe character and the breakneck speed of the story more than make up for that shortcoming.

Although he didnt know that himself.  But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever.  Tracking down the picture Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years.  She gives Charlie a mysterious package (that he cant open) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world.  As it turns out Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding.  The Red Kings children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since.  At Bloors Academy Charlie finds friends and enemies and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others dont want revealed.Jenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other childrens books and fantasies.Many people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter and thats a good comparison.  But the two series are different.  Harrys family is really non-supportive but Charlie has a loving mother a doting grandmother and Uncle Paton who turns out to be something of a hero.  The book is a fun fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries magic and friendship.  Even at 400 pages it feels like its over much too soon.There are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected moving from one character and one scene into another without warning.  They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story but noticeable all the same.Fans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who havent tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so.

A dog who is happy roaming about the country with his master Willie G. Christmas. If Willie is homeless probably schizophrenic certainly eccentric; if they rarely have enough to eat; if he doesnt always understand Willies metaphysical ramblings--what does that matter between a dog and his best friend? Alas in the first chapter Willie is coughing up blood and Mr. Bones knows that Willie is going to die.The entire story is told through the point of view of this remarkable dog. Is it the story of a dog? Or the story of Willie? Or the story of life in America? Or a story about love alienation betrayal and loss? Well its all of these. And what is Timbuktu? For that you will have to read the book. Im not going to tell you.Author Paul Auster is a genius with language. Somehow he draws you into this improbable story and makes it believable. More than believable. Compelling. Does he really get inside the mind of a dog? Who am I to say? I can only say that for me he makes the mind of a dog as believable and understandable as any other mind. Some reviewers expressed disappointment with this book but I thought it was wonderful. Just let it speak in its own voice and take it for what it is and you will love it. I recommend Timbuktu highly. Reviewed by Louis N.

1046,0671976532:mr._lynch_shares_more_of_his_expertise...:bruce_gilliz,671976532,Beating the Street: Books: Peter Lynch,books,3,Mr. Lynch Shares More of His Expertise...,December 26 2005,Bruce Gilliz,Charlottetown Prince Edward Island Canada,When Peter S. Lynch speaks wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund managers career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to 90 and post career into 92.  Its far more introspective than One Up On Wall Street and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example there isnt nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading One Up On Wall Street first and follow up with this title as its the newer of the two regardless. Peters style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in.  To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry.  The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point.  I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isnt childs play (unless you like playing with money).And although this book doesnt cover nearly as much technical information as the first it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers.  I made plenty of notes while reading Beating The Street and Im confident that Ill be well served by doing so.  Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates.Overall this title definitely deserves four stars and his first book deserves at least five stars.  Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. Youll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection.  ,6.0,6.0,Peter Lynch,when peter s lynch speaks wise investors listen book covers famous fund managers career helm fidelity magellan 1977 90 post career into 92 far more introspective than one up wall street no doubt meant purpose example there isnt nearly much fundamental principles stock picking outlined book former belief reader would do best reading one up wall street first follow up title newer two regardless peters style writing john rothchild nononsense easy take knowledge three books have been published duo all three have been entertaining never dry reader can comfortably take some very important stockpicking principles one greats without feeling intimidated any point think sign well written book covers topic isnt childs play unless like playing moneyand although book doesnt cover nearly much technical information first still offers lot tasty tidbits stock pickers made plenty notes while reading beating street im confident ill well served doing so peter reiterates many guidelines mentioned his first bestseller such scrutinizing company earnings balance sheets gives his wise opinion picking bargain stocks have lower pes than growth ratesoverall title definitely deserves four stars his first book deserves least five stars lynch rothchild have authored several investing books stand test time youll sleep better investment decisions having valuable classics collection

This approach generated a number of divisional championships for Oakland in the weakest American League divisionbut no pennants and world championships.There are omitted variables and misspecification  problems in the sabermetrics(statistics) approach of Bill James used by Beane.FirstJamess system totally ignores the number of batter strikeouts.All outs are not equal.Hitting flyouts and groundball outs will many times advance the baserunner if any previous batters got on base.Hitting the ball also allows the baserunner to get on on an error.Strikeouts are thus the worst type of out.This omitted variables problem can be dealt with by simply deducting 1  to 1.25 points from the on base percentage for every strikeout oversay100 for a regulareveryday player who gets 600 official at bats over the course of the season.The second problem is that the James system does not differentiate between walks due to the hitting skill of the batter and walks used by the pitcher to set up forceplays and double playsespecially if he is a pitcher who gets a lot of ground ball outs.Another category is needed-walks that are not followed by forceouts or double play groundouts and/or walks where the runner is able to steal second base.These walks are different from the walks given to a 40 homer player who strikes out 150+ times a year and hits .250 but has a .375 OBP.

Westbrook GTW,Texas,Background		I read Isaacs Storm by Erik Larson around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes two killer blizzards and one flash flood. Galveston and related Hurricanes	My first impression was that anyone who had read this book about a major hurricane would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters. Isaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900 with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general and Issac Cline their station chief for this area in particular that essentially preempted any warning. Cline was one of the new men a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms. First the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba. The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who said the storm was nothing to worry about. Cubans own weather observers who had pioneered hurricane detection disagreed. Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that any storm warning had to come from the Washington office with absolutely no exceptions. Finally Isaac had the conviction and public position that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters. 	Larson cited two older hurricanes in his book. * September 16 1875 - The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay,1.0,1.0,Erik Larson,background read isaacs storm erik larson around 1998 recently had occasion thumb through again which prompted review larson covered three killer hurricanes two killer blizzards one flash flood galveston related hurricanes first impression anyone who had read book about major hurricane would never consider riding out such storm larson painted frightening story brick homes brick schools being torn apart surging waters isaac cline u s weather service chief galveston time book gives much detail galveston storm hit island september 1900 very little warning indeed arrogance u s weather service general issac cline station chief area particular essentially preempted any warning cline one new men scientist who believed knew all there know about motion clouds behavior storms first u s weather service refused pay any attention any inputs cuba u s weather service had men stationed cuba who said storm nothing worry about cubans own weather observers who had pioneered hurricane detection disagreed secondly u s weather service insisted any storm warning had come washington office absolutely no exceptions finally isaac had conviction public position no hurricane could ever hit galveston would steered north before reaching far west galveston such position cline had no motivation try influence headquarters larson cited two older hurricanes his book september 16 1875 storm raised immense dome water shoved through indianola pushing waters gulf matagorda bay

Grisham gives you just enough inside details to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grishams writings makes for a very enjoyable read. One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection even though at the same time Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.Overall this is a very captivating page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it as well as Grishams other books. So far I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy,1.0,5.0,John Grisham,third book have read grisham so far have really enjoyed each one grisham really knows how write good legal thriller book does not have any courtroomcourtcase scenes which really enjoy still kept attention very well grisham gives just enough inside details keep guessing without actually telling answer example one point clues seemed point fletcher coal being involved killings way off mark end characteristic grishams writings makes very enjoyable read one few complaints about book sudden romance between gray darby had hardly even met before seemed become attracted then very quickly blossomed into open show affection even though same time darby supposedly mourning thomas even so probably main thing seems wrong about book does not detract overall quality very much alloverall very captivating pageturner book really holds attention highly recommend well grishams other books so far have found grisham awesome writer legal thrillers promise not disappointed read enjoy

What about the cashier at Walmart who is catty?  And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys.  Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize.   In this novel gods (which represent animals) roam the earth in the bodies of humans.  The main character is the clever trouble-loving spider who interacts with other animal-gods in everyday human life.  This book along with other science fiction books has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination. The strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman.  On par with Douglas Adams the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky pop-culture laden humor.  The main character Fat Charlie I found much in common with.  His awkward moments with friends family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with.  The story however isnt anything special.  I like witches and animal-gods as much as the next guy but the plot is uninteresting.  It is a rare book that combines wit with plot and this is not one of those rare books. ,,,Neil Gaiman,know guy down street who acts awful snakelike what about cashier walmart who catty there always people our lives could easily one many species monkeys neil gaiman shows through fiction there may more strange characters our lives than realize novel gods which represent animals roam earth bodies humans main character clever troubleloving spider who interacts other animalgods everyday human life book along other science fiction books given appreciation creativity human imagination strong point novel humor employed neil gaiman par douglas adams author anasi boys fills pages quirky popculture laden humor main character fat charlie found much common his awkward moments friends family everyone else reveal social insecurity many familiar story however isnt anything special like witches animalgods much next guy plot uninteresting rare book combines wit plot not one rare books

Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE. The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++ Java or C# you may be struck by its simplicity compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.I wonder a little about the book itself though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher who can then instruct from it,9.0,11.0,St�phane Ducasse,use integrated development environment ide user learn language then program within well known microsoft made powerful ides languages open source eclipse can used java along lines ducasse offers his book teaches smalltalk using squeak ide twist squeak uses visual metaphors robots robot factory convey crucial concepts objectsclasses ducasse explains squeak can directed audience perhaps high school age or even younger so clear visual feedback between example code what student sees then happen vital given her limited background possibly limited attention span squeak uses smalltalk part because very minimalist language if come c java or c may struck simplicity compared oodles classes notational intricacies languages which course also makes easier young student learn smalltalk or squeak itselfi wonder little about book itself though motivated high school student could easily use some younger students situation may well book could best directed teacher who can then instruct

Middleton,Australia,In this fascinating collection of essays Dr. Dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis. Over the last twenty-five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms subsidised housing free by-weekly pay checks child support and free medical benefits. From a liberal political standpoint this support for the nations have nots is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor. One would logically assume that providing the poor with lifes essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society. In fact as Dalrymple proposes it has had an opposite effect: crime in his native England has skyrocketed; drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence. Why? Liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives it is always the rich the government or societies institutions that is to blame thus crime continues to rise while Englands Welfare State has grown into an unwieldy Goliath.  Dalrymple has worked in numerous countries and has been an attending physician and psychiatric consultant in Londons prisons for many years. Thus his thesis is not born from some abstract social theory about human behaviour. He has treated thousands of victims of domestic violence consulted thousands of prisoners who have been incarcerated for petty crime to murder. The common thread that runs through all these cases is a pathological denial of responsibility for their own circumstances or conditions. As Dalrymple explains:Like so many modern ills the coarseness of spirit and behaviour grows out of ideas brewed up in the academy and among intellectuals - ideas that have seeped outward and are now having their practical effect on society.

Birkett,Suffern NY USA,A fraudulent marine biologist whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him. Its a wonderfully comic page-turner although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard such as Maximum Bob and Stick but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick). I thought this was his best since Striptease. The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although Im a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.

1078,0736637826:off_the_shelf_just_in_time:heavy_theta,736637826,Mason & Dixon Part B: Books: Thomas Pynchon,books,5,off the shelf just in time,September 15 2006,Heavy Theta,Lorton Va United States,This thing sat on my shelf half-read for the longest time.  Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchons next got me motivated enough to dig into it again.  Its not that it isnt brilliant.  No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder.  The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything youll ever read.And its not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into.  There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravitys Rainbow before catching the wave.  But Mason and Dixon is a lot of work if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style.  (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?)  John Barths Sotweed Factor is  similar and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!).  Pynchons gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness.  Especially in a work this voluminous.And yet the darn thing is consistently challenging if one has the patience and energy to put into it.  It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book and the emotional satisfaction one gains when reaching towards the conclusion.  One thing for sure for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels).  This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.  This book is a great as you want it to be if youre willing to work at it.

Bryant be7701,Washington DC,This Bible blew me away when I went hunting for one a few months ago to give to a youth who had come into my life.  I was so impressed I  bought one for myself.  This Bible is many things but the first thing that I noticed quite honestly is that the colors were bright the print readable and the illustrations far less serious and far more engaging than your typical Bible.  Without growing to an unwieldy size the editors manage to throw in a wealth of study information written in a modern friendly style that helps make even the dryest or most confusing parts of the Good Book both understandable and relevant to todays society.  That is what makes it perfect for someone like my young friend who is unfamiliar with religion Christianity or just plain old Bible study.  Its less intimidating that most Bibles and all material is presented in such a manner that you dont feel unprepared if you pick it up cold.  Catholics are often les familiar with the Bible than many Protestant denominations as we have a wholistic focus that is both valuable and worthwhile--however a better relationship and understanding of the Word can only enhance ones spiritual life and experience as a Catholic.  If that applies to you (which I have to admit it did to me) this is a wonderful way to get your feet wet in Biblical translation discussion interpretation and modern relevance.  Who wont like this Bible?  1 - Those more familiar and attached to more formal translations such as the King James Version 2 - Those already familiar with intensive Bible study IF not working with youth or those less familiar 3 - most Protestants...the discussion is from a very clear Catholic viewpoint...not really controversial just Catholic 4 - and traditionalists who are offended by the idea of making the Bible accessible and relevant through use of the,16.0,20.0,Brian Singer-Towns,bible blew away when went hunting one few months ago give youth who had come into life so impressed bought one myself bible many things first thing noticed quite honestly colors bright print readable illustrations far less serious far more engaging than typical bible without growing unwieldy size editors manage throw wealth study information written modern friendly style helps make even dryest or most confusing parts good book both understandable relevant todays society what makes perfect someone like young friend who unfamiliar religion christianity or just plain old bible study less intimidating most bibles all material presented such manner dont feel unprepared if pick up cold catholics often les familiar bible than many protestant denominations have wholistic focus both valuable worthwhilehowever better relationship understanding word can only enhance ones spiritual life experience catholic if applies which have admit did wonderful way get feet wet biblical translation discussion interpretation modern relevance who wont like bible 1 more familiar attached more formal translations such king james version 2 already familiar intensive bible study if not working youth or less familiar 3 most protestantsthe discussion very clear catholic viewpointnot really controversial just catholic 4 traditionalists who offended idea making bible accessible relevant through use

Grant,books,5,Must Read on a Neglected Topic,October 17 2004,Brett Steenbarger,Naperville IL  USA,In his book Trading Risk Ken Grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for Tudor Investments and SAC Capital to create an insightful and surprisingly non-technical guide for traders and portfolio managers.  As Director of Trader Development at a large proprietary trading house I have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders.  Moreover this is a scalable difference: risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades results of trading days and performance across entire quarters.  Where I believe Grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply cutting your losses.  Trading Risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results.  His discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of self-analysis that is rarely practiced.Perhaps an example from my own work with traders that overlaps Grants ideas might be illustrative.  I encourage traders to keep a log of all their trades that tracks time of day position taken position size holding period and profit/loss (P/L).  Changes to the position are also documented as traders scale into or out of trades.  From this record we can evaluate a host of performance statistics such as position sizing as a function of market volume/volatility the correlation of profitability with trade size/holding period and patterns of activity within the trading day.  While Grants background is with portfolio management-appropriate to a manager who is holding a basket of positions in a variety of equities-his ideas are easily adaptable to the intraday,16.0,19.0,Kenneth L.

Davis,books,4,A nice ride,February 13 2006,boomer,Michigan,Once again I am amazed by the amount of controversy associated with a book addressing a religious subject.  I bought this to get a better feel for the Old Testament [operative word is feel].  As a Roman Catholic the Old Testament is addressed in the first reading at Mass but then brushed over for the most part in a cursory manner.  It is particularly confusing hard to read and difficult to understand in proper context without some help.  In fact there are portions of the Old Testament that just seem cruel and ridiculous.  Daviss book helps to demonstrate that it was written by people in a certain time and place and within a historical milieu.  It may not maintain the historical accuracy some may like but it is sufficient to be effective.  It is just too simplistic to look to the Bible for all answers; as if it were some sort of statutory code with the answers to all questions.   The search and answers for truth are never ending and the Bible is a beginning.  I get more from Catholic writers who explore the Bible and the traditions of my religion relative to our world than I do from the book itself.  Davis is throwing in his spin as well as a pretty accurate assessment of the Bible in historical context which I found quite helpful.  Take it for what is worth a spin in a convertible through the Bible.  A nice ride but nothing more. ,6.0,6.0,Kenneth C.

WheelockBen Broos,books,5,An essential book for art lovers!,April 19 2002,Bragan Thomas,NYC,I was fortunate enough to have seen the now-legendary Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. during the winter of 1995-96.  21 out of the 35 (or 36) extant paintings by Vermeer were included in the show offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of Vermeers amazing works in a single space something that no one has experienced since 1696 when @20 of his paintings were auctioned in Delft.  Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeers works it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated. All who were unable to make it to the show however have this splendid book as a document of this unique event.  This book will remain the standard work on Vermeer for many decades and represents the fruit of several years labor by art historians on two continents. Because so little is in fact known about Vermeer the man (in truth we have no idea at all what Vermeers education interests and personality were like) the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing Vermeers work within the history of Dutch painting the development of perspective and the fascinating tale of Vermeers &quot;rediscovery&quot; in the 19th century and his richly-deserved rise to worldwide fame. The essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct Vermeers exact technique something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves (no drawings by Vermeer have survived nor have any statements he may have made about painting).  This extensive scholarly apparatus while illuminating and occasionally even riveting (the essay dealing with Vermeers rediscovery is a great detective narrative!) tends to obscure the strange even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with.

Wouldnt we all like to ignite our own creative fires even if they come out in different ways perhaps in writing perhaps in our work lives or the time we spend with our families or while alone.    One of the main lessons I got from this book is that being fully open as possible to ones imagination hopes dreams and aspirations can lead in wondrous directions and affect even the most practical or mundane tasks of life. It just takes the willingness to take the risk to accept failure and setbacks in return for spiritual and emotional growth and lifechanging experiences.    This is more than a book geared to artists and peformers. It truly is for the rest of us. It can change your life.     Having said that I found myself wanting more felt myself not quite fully satisfied by this book. I felt some of the sections were a little too pat or formulaic.

Yes the plot is lifted directly from Star Wars. Yes there are obvious references to Anne McCaffrey Tolkien and other fantasy writers. But who cares?Eragon is above all else an enjoyable read. Despite underlying flaws in the writing Paolini effectively tells a rewarding good-versus-evil story in a clearly-defined world with a well-thought-out magic system and a realism Tolkien could never muster. Sure Eragon has its critics (mostly aspiring writers that have not enjoyed Paolinis success) but if you can ignore their blustering and simply take the book at face value I think youll be pleasantly surprised. Although not as epic or impressive as some of the older fantasy works Eragon is nonetheless a great read,,,Christopher Paolini,yes cliche yes plot lifted directly star wars yes there obvious references anne mccaffrey tolkien other fantasy writers who careseragon above all else enjoyable read despite underlying flaws writing paolini effectively tells rewarding goodversusevil story clearlydefined world wellthoughtout magic system realism tolkien could never muster sure eragon critics mostly aspiring writers have not enjoyed paolinis success if can ignore blustering simply take book face value think youll pleasantly surprised although not epic or impressive some older fantasy works eragon nonetheless great read

My mouth watered as I read the included reprints of her past reviews of NYC restaurants - even after my five days of fantastic Spanish cuisine!  But more surprisingly I was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the NYC restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters.  The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience especially in NYCs best restaurants.  Her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective (as objective as food tastes get I suppose) review.

I have and I am now losing weight eating anything yes anything I want.  Can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened?  This is the book that will set you free this is the book you need. Has it struck you that dieting is unnatural?  Dont eat this dont eat that count this count that measure this measure that I cant have this and I cant have that ad nauseum.  Which diet guru are you going to believe?  Can you reall stay with a low-carb diet or a high-carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life?  Most importantly do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life?  The first day of my new eating pattern I ate two meals.  The second day I woke up with no hunger no reactive hypoglycemia (nausea and shakes from hunger)!  What a miracle.  I have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything I want for dinner (I love to cook and desire to eat with my family).  At maintenance I may end up eating two meals a day; I dont know and it certainly isnt something to &quot;worry&quot; about.  The diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later etc. are wrong wrong wrong.  Maybe it sounds theoretically correct but it does not work that way.  Listen I have found out the less you eat the less you eat.  I do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach.  By the way Dr. Dean Edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself.  He says there is NO scientific proof that X number of meals are better than one.  Also I want you dear readers to know that I have four friends who are &quot;naturally&quot; slim (adult women - 30s and 40s). Two of them eat a small amount for lunch (like a small hamburger) and a good dinner (they are sizes 3 and 6).  One gal eats at 2:30 PM a huge amount and a snack at night (she is size 7).  One gal does nibble all day like a potato chip here and there (no thank you personally).

First covers networking.

It talks about developing interpersonal skills public speaking skills prospecting skills networking etiquette sales skills marketing principles and even customer service. It mentions the power of the Thank You note and of giving more than you receive. It also devotes a chapter on some things about home-based businesses. And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity. Im not sure the mail order chapter should have been included. Quite frankly I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here. And I think Chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book and not included in this book either. But who cares! Anybody interested in the main thrust of the book (endless referrals) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 - and they are well written and informative.What I liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter. I did not have to wade through the book the first time through. I just had to read the summaries. The other thing that was really nice about the book was the recommended reading sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book.

Adcock doctor dale RN,Detroit,	Conservatives Without Conscience does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science.  There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics and how it applies to our modern political landscape. 	 This is not new information it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party.  The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public.  Finally someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see.  Knowledge is power so everyone should read his book.  However one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits.  They dont tend to read books much anyway.  It is a book  for the open minded that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape  the by any means necessary tactics of many named players and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. 	John Dean pulls no punches.  He names names and kicks butt.  He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism but even that is well worth the effort. If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who  unquestionably support them then read this book.

John Roebling and his son Washington did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge. Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. But the Roeblings gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many including Washington with a condition known as the bends. Washingtons wife Emily was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.There are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.   McCulloughs book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering.

Gage does things a little differently than anyone else which is something I quickly discovered when reading this book. This book is brash to the point and filled with insight and inspiration. I thought that Gage presented his points in a well thought out manner that really took the establishment on head on.Many points presented in the book are in other personal development books. However I dont know of any book that has all these points in one book. Even Gage himself admits in an interview that this is a combination of Think and Grow Rich The Secret Ayn Rand and several other books and cds.A lot of it you have heard before like if you say you are broke then you will always be broke. However I didnt realize how much the mainstream media and the political establishment are contributing to our negative broke thoughts. Most frightening of all I learned why the establishment needs us to be broke in order to keep their power. I am taking Randys lead and watching less TV especially the news. Thats the worst of all!There is also a nice introduction to Libertarianism and the works of Ayn Rand. As a Libertarian myself I was delighted to see this included in the book. With recent reports circulating about Britain on the verge of becoming a police state this warning about big government couldnt have come at a more appropriate time.As expected Randy does make a plug for MLM but this is by no means an MLM book. The MLM plug is just a few short pages. However it is still a nice resource for MLM people to use for third party credibility. He also mentioned real estate and information marketing as good businesses as well.

He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but shes with someone else. Leaphorn meanwhile is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. No Navajo would be involved as stealing pots like this would make one a Thief of Time according to Navajo tradition.Chees letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorns investigation and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boys death by drowning before this one wraps up and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor.It seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli the Watersprinkler will play a vital part in this mystery. But Eleanors interest is also anthropological and someone thinks what shes discovered is worth killing for.Leaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery.

1128,0140444173:war_and_peace:_both_inscrutable:martin_asiner,140444173,War and Peace (Penguin Classics): Books: Leo TolstoyRosemary  Edmonds,books,5,War and Peace: Both Inscrutable,August 22 2006,Martin Asiner,jersey city nj United States,Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it I read it as a novel for entertainment. Years later I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading I was able to examine the Russian names characters events and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going which it certainly is but in it Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space with one atom colliding at random with another but when a sufficient number act in concert such as Napoleons invasion of Russia their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature.  This one Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God.

The intelligence community can simply say that intelligence is a tricky business and sometimes you get it wrong. This of course provides a convenient excuse for the politicians and compliant media to contend that they were simply acting in the public interest based upon the information they were given......In the end to accept the concept of Iraq as an intelligence failure one must first accept the premise that the USA was implementing as its primary objective for Iraq the Security Councils resolutions on disarmament. This argument is simpy not sustainable. The behavior of the United States government and its intelligence agencies during my time as an inspector was not that of a government that was serious about disarmament. Support for UNSCOMs mission was at best tailored to the political imperatives at any given time. There was a total willingness to compromise the integrity of UNSCOM (and with it the whole notion of multilateral disarmament) for short-term tactical advantages in the battle between the US and Iraqi regimes. Towards the end of the inspections era elements of the US government actively sought to make UNSCOMs job more difficult by cutting it off from intelligence sources. Disarmament was simply not the USAs principal policy objective in Iraq after 1991. Regime change was.The CIA was designated as the principal implementer of this policy. Therefore when one looks at the March 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent removal of power of the government of Saddam Hussein the only conclusion that can be reached is that the CIA accomplished its mission.

1131,0340833815:layered_plot_with_plenty_of_twists_and_turns...:thomas_duff_duffbert,340833815,The Cold Moon: Books: Jeffery Deaver,books,5,Layered plot with plenty of twists and turns...,November 5 2006,Thomas Duff Duffbert,Portland OR United States,Its been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read.  Therefore I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library.  The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for...  twists turns and plenty of forensic work.The plotline here starts out on two tracks.  A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques.  His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene. Rhyme and Amelia Sachs his partner are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die.  Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder.  The murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis.  Theres a strong chance that the cops are corrupt so Sachs has to step carefully as its not clear who she can trust.  The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating.  But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker...If you want plot twists and turns this book will definitely satisfy.  There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion only to be something else entirely.  The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction.  A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top but not so much as to put me off the story.  Its a book I really didnt want to put down even though I had other things I should be doing..,,,Jeffery Deaver,been awhile since had really good crime mystery read therefore excited when cold moon jeffery deaver arrived library latest lincoln rhyme novel delivered just what looking twists turns plenty forensic workthe plotline here starts out two tracks killer nicknamed watchmaker murdering people using slow torture techniques his signature leaving particular clock style scene rhyme amelia sachs his partner put case order solve before more people die sachs also running her own case involving apparent suicide really turns out murder murder points rundown bar where group cops meet regular basis theres strong chance cops corrupt so sachs step carefully not clear who she can trust two cases converge when watchmaker captured reality his killings turn out carefully staged plan expose corruption sachs investigating layering deception goes even deeper than rhyme continue dig through each apparent motive story finally get core truth behind watchmakerif want plot twists turns book definitely satisfy there number scenes appear transpiring one fashion only something else entirely layering plots killer never seems end each new revelation ends up being start new level distraction couple twists seemed bit over top not so much put off story book really didnt want put down even though had other things should doing
1132,0062507540:the_point_of_unlimited_possibility:r._b._weeks,62507540,Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche: Books: Robert A. Johnson,books,5,The point of unlimited possibility,October 1 2005,R. B. Weeks,Cincinnati OH United States,This was the first book by Johnson I read though my mentors and teachers spoke of him often. The information about the mandorla was particularly helpful giving a visual and archetypical model for holding the energy of the apparently opposite forces in a space of new possibility. Johnson writes that if I can be with the opposites at the point of their intersection and stay with my conflicting thoughts and impulses long enough the two will teach each other something and produce an insight that serves both... produce something utterly new instead of win lose or compromise.  The key appears to be that every real solution has to grow from the unique situation I face. Formulas how-tos devices and processes can never be enough in such moments. Referring to my own past for an experiential reference or to anothers experience or advice cant do it either because it prevents or sidetracks the point of unlimited potential that wants to appear in and emerge out of each unique encounter.I liked what Maria had to say in her post: Meet your shadow dated November 22 2003. She said she gave it only 4 stars because he doesnt tell how to DO that is described as possible in the book... I felt a little of that too. And I have since appreciated the blessing of not being told how until Ive done a bit of my own struggle with my own opposites in many life situations. A book I found to be a perfect companion to this one is I of the Storm - Embracing Conflict Creating Peace by Gary Simmons. I highly recommend it in addition to this book. It addresses some of the questions I felt about the nature of conflict after finishing Owning Your Own Shadow in a way that shed light into my life.

Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through.  The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power.  Instead of branding China as a villain we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains China wouldnt be where it is now.  Wal-Mart is covered in detail.  The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing its only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it.  Then theres another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour.  Chinas progress isnt simply detrimental to other countries.  On contrary it benefits them as well.  For example Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China.  With increase of living standard in China Chinese needs more nutritious food.  As China couldnt provide enough United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom.  Then there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth.

He focuses on the debate between the formalists (who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing framing mise-en-scene lighting and etc.) and the realist tradition (who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography a physical impression of its subject). The highlight is undoubtedly Andrews excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin which is not surprising since Andrews Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. The weaknesses: This was published in 1976 and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then especially feminism and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory.

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a complex mixture of simple things. The simplicity of the language style ideas characters and concepts is unique to this book. The expression of complicated life matters and situations in such a simple manner makes this book a definite must-have. In the book Mark Haddon borrows the voice of his lead character Christopher an autistic child to tell the story. Christopher is an autistic and smart 15 year old boy. Hes a math whiz with an unsatisfiable appetite to solve problems. His approach to all life issues is to convert them into a math problem of some sort and find out ways to deal with these issues. The story mainly revolves around Christophers investigation to find out who killed his neighbours dog Wellington. Despite his fathers instructions to not pursue the issue Christopher goes on to attempt to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington. The story unravels before Christopher and he is hit with a reality far more complex than his own understanding of life. His investigations result in only unearthing long buried secrets of his mother who he knows died three years earlier. Christophers determination to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington and the mystery of his mothers death is something to be revered throughout the development of the story. The childs emotional roller coaster ride is witnessed first hand on every page. The reader experiences Christophers feelings and emotions so transparently that it makes it extremely difficult not to feel attached to the story. The story in itself is funny at times sad and miserable at others; complex in one place and extremely simple in another. This is a novel that you can be certain will change the way you perceive the things in your life once you are through.

This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.EVERYONE ignored it. The CDC the NIH the National Cancer Institute it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs and straight people and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a gay disease. Gay men didnt want to discuss that it might be spread through sex and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldnt even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.By the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS over 25000 Americans were dead from the disease.This book made me cry. The entire way through it I wanted to scream I wanted to throw things I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark Well at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people. How absolutely disgusting. This is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading all of it frustrating angering scream-inducing and yet still inspiring. They didnt give up.

World building. By this we mean the setting the characters and everything else where our story will occur. For me this often means maps memories and visits since I write about where I live. But if youd like to see exactly what world building means head down to your local library and grab SALEMS LOT by Stephen King. Yeah thats right Im reviewing a book by Stephen King. As if his career really needs my help. (I bought my copy at Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Lu in Hangzhou with a new introduction that is a pleasure to read but I mentioned the library to save you some money.) When Stephen King mania first gripped the English-speaking world I missed it. I saw the film of CARRIE and hated it. Years later at a guard desk on a long shift scheduled so suddenly that I hadnt had a chance to visit the library I read what was in the desk instead. THINNER. If I were Stephen King Id have put a pen name on that crap as well. One of Kings fans brought me around. She recommended THE SHINING. Of course I thought of that Kubrick/Nicholson travesty. No no she said read the book. Its much different. Yes it is. Its fantastic for its perceptiveness. Next up PET SEMATARY which scared the crap out of me. And that my friends is not easy. ON WRITING. Ive gushed about that enough times. The films STAND BY ME and THE APT PUPIL. So in the end I appreciate King and forgive him for CARRIE and I think hes forgiven himself. We wont talk about the Richard Bachman alias although the film of THE RUNNING MAN was fun in a stupid sort of way. SALEMS LOT. Kings second book and perhaps it should have been his first. Ive been in China since 1999. If I ever want to visit a town in the US I dont need a plane ticket. I can just real SALEMS LOT. Consider it a clinic on world building. These are the places and the people I left behind right there ,2.0,6.0,Stephen King,see phrase lot when visit howto sites writers world building mean setting characters everything else where our story occur often means maps memories visits since write about where live if youd like see exactly what world building means head down local library grab salems lot stephen king yeah thats right im reviewing book stephen king if his career really needs help bought copy foreign language bookstore yanan lu hangzhou new introduction pleasure read mentioned library save some money when stephen king mania first gripped englishspeaking world missed saw film carrie hated years later guard desk long shift scheduled so suddenly hadnt had chance visit library read what desk instead thinner if stephen king id have put pen name crap well one kings fans brought around she recommended shining course thought kubricknicholson travesty no no she said read book much different yes fantastic perceptiveness next up pet sematary which scared crap out friends not easy writing ive gushed about enough times films stand apt pupil so end appreciate king forgive him carrie think hes forgiven himself wont talk about richard bachman alias although film running man fun stupid sort way salems lot kings second book perhaps should have been his first ive been china since 1999 if ever want visit town us dont need plane ticket can just real salems lot consider clinic world building places people left behind right there

It is one of his seminal achievements. The book simply shines with humor well drawn characters action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts. It is also one of his smoothest rides. One gets the feeling that Hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote.	Here is an overview that will stimulate readers interest Hiassins. The book opens with Chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship but by some twists and turns and luck Joey survives long enough to be rescued. Much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as Joey and her team pursue vengeance. By the midpoint of the novel Chaz is already an emotional wreck and it doesnt look like Joey is about to let up any time soon. The moral backbone of the novel is twofold. One is the pitting of the Everglades Forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants. The Everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many Floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business. Hiassins two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book but also lends it a feeling of seriousness.	And two is the pitting of criminals against victims who arent going to take it anymore.  Hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to Joey. As most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to ones helplessness. 	There are six main characters in the book: Joey and her horny husband Chaz Joeys rescuer Mick who is a kind and eccentric ex-policeman who lives alone on an island Joeys brother a rich expatriate who raises sheep in New ,1.0,1.0,Carl Hiaasen,someone write biography carl hiassin fifty years hard imagine or she wouldnt focus authors latest triumph skinny dip one his seminal achievements book simply shines humor well drawn characters action usual everyone gets just desserts also one his smoothest rides one gets feeling hiassin very confident every sentence wrote here overview stimulate readers interest hiassins book opens chaz trying kill his wife flinging her over rail cruise ship some twists turns luck joey survives long enough rescued much rest book circles around characters interactions relationships joey her team pursue vengeance midpoint novel chaz already emotional wreck doesnt look like joey about let up any time soon moral backbone novel twofold one pitting everglades forest her defenders against big business her pollutants everglades quickly turning pristine swamp into another type ecosystem entirely many floridians want prevent remaining land being destroyed which means millions dollars loss big agricultural business hiassins two segments real life plight swamp standout bit apart book also lends feeling seriousness two pitting criminals against victims who arent going take anymore hiassin his when reapetedly refers attempted murder insult joey most survivors violent crime can ascertain there severe indignity attached ones helplessness there six main characters book joey her horny husband chaz joeys rescuer mick who kind eccentric expoliceman who lives alone island joeys brother rich expatriate who raises sheep new

1174,0671691988:a_better_title_might_be:_a_truly_great_americans_life:marvin_d._pipher,671691988,An American Life: The Autobiography: Books: Ronald Reagan,books,5,A better title might be: A Truly Great Americans Life,September 13 2005,Marvin D. Pipher,Houston Texas USA,As one of Americas greatest presidents Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.  This book and his earlier autobiography Wheres the Rest of Me will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.  This work An American Life however will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.  For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagans political commentaries on the radio or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.  What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.  You may also observe that the problems of Reagans day are not much different than those we face today.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan how his many faceted character was formed the inner workings of his mind and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.  In my view it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child. ,8.0,10.0,Ronald Reagan,one americas greatest presidents ronald reagan certainly studied historians years come like abraham lincoln likely revered discussed people all nationalities many generations book his earlier autobiography wheres rest surely touch stones any such inquiries discussions work american life however primary importance since addresses his entire life political career rather than simply earlier part his life during which time primarily sportscaster actor anyone who had pleasure listening reagans political commentaries radio or hearing him speak governor california or president united states book particularly enjoyable written easygoing conversational style reagan used life what makes book even more interesting can not only catch glimpse country into which ronald reagan born also see how country transformed into nation know today may also observe problems reagans day not much different than face today would highly recommend book anyone seeking understand ronald reagan how his many faceted character formed inner workings his mind actions which led his monumental achievements view would benefit country greatly if book made required reading every american child

Chambers,Georgia United States,I love historical fiction and The March was one of the better historical novels that Ive read. The characters are well-drawn and the action moves along briskly with no dead spots.  The civil war background seemed very authentic and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.Doctorow is an excellent writer and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.  My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.  Thats not true as studies of Union soldiers letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members or for other reasons than just slavery.  That also applies to Confederate soldiers.  A minor quibble that doesnt really hurt the book but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real documented historical fact.Highly recommended,2.0,2.0,E.L.

He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain. The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America. Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class. The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America). For all of those who are interested in a better understanding of Latin American societies of today this great book is a must. Lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the Hispanic American societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis.

Morris,brooklyn,I recommend that most people do NOT read this book.  If you choose to ignore me and you read the work anyway please first be remotely acquainted with and keep in mind a few things before you attempt to do so (and certainly before you try to express an ostensibly reputable opinion on Amazon): **magical realism**; Jewish history religion culture and humor(although the last is perhaps redundant); memory; folk lore; the English language; love; the nature of histories; sex; death; pain; narrative style and voice; the multiplicity of human and likewise Jewish experience; imagination.  I will assert because I hope it is true that you dont need to all of these things to enjoy Illuminated but you do need to be familiar with some of it.  And you must be willing to spend some time with this book to enjoy it.  All those with self-diagnosed A.D.D. need not bother cracking the spine. However even if you qualify despite the rigor of what may be required of you everything may be indeed sadly obfuscated.  Or perhaps less disappointingly only partly obfuscated.  If so dont get angry. Dont curse the gods or creative writing programs. And certainly if you are going to write bad reviews on Amazon preface it first with your own faults as a reader. Lastly buck up.  Read another book.  Even the Bible (another little book high up on the best sellers list) is not for everyone.And for those of you out there who disagree to my approach with this review of Illuminated that is fine.  Dismiss it.  At least please dont take the advice of any other critic here who speaks in an equally perturbed voice.  Moreover dont read it for the reviews...Actually stop reading reviews.

Liberty 1st,January 25 2005,Charles Darwin,Austin Texas USA,Its been several years since I read the book.  Saw it recently the book seems to be a favorite of the coffee-house talky chattering left Marx-Freud-Rousseau crowd.    However all this at talk of a just society and the underprivileged can and does mean only one thing:  A POLICE STATE.   Anytime a so-called theory attempts to create a utopian state there will be coercion.   Anytime there is coercion you will infringe upon individual rights freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom to govern ones own life.  Instead of a police state in the form of a theory of justice.  He should have written a book titled A Theory of Liberty  Any society without liberty as the foundation will have coercion and hence the destruction of liberty.   However this book remains the coffee-house favorite.Rawls was an Ivory Tower Pinhead.  A brief bio states that he was a professor all his adult life.  What kind of adults spend their whole life having fake phony welfare for intellectual make-believe jobs like being a professor of political theory. What dat?????  Oh Please get a real job.#1.

Is change feasible in todays society?  Howard Zinn attempts to answer these two questions along with a number of others in his book entitled You Cant Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.  A beautifully written and inspirational book You Cant Be Neutral on a Moving Train is quintessential Zinn-direct yet optimistic.  Zinns central argument is that we are all capable of participating in change however for change to occur we must all experience a social and political reawakening.  Zinns book offers the reader a more hopeful version of politics and society.  Yet such a version is only feasible if we as Americans actively participate in the political process.

(Spanish): Books: Maurice SendakArthur YorinksMatthew Reinhart,books,5,Amazing!,October 8 2006,dephal,California,Ive been a Sendak junkie since I was a kid. His books have always been among my very favorites and Im happy to say theyre among my kids favorites as well. I also love pop-ups so I was really excited to learn about this book. And I must say my expectations have been surpassed.The story line is very simple: a young child looks for his Mommy encountering various monsters along the way and defeating them in creative ways. There are only a few written words in the book. But the story that the pictures tell is wonderful. What child wouldnt be delighted by a book in which a kid defeats the wolfman by pantsing him? Nosferatu gets a binky! And theres a ton of detail in the pictures as well. My girls like to spend several minutes looking at each page spread.Then there are the pop-ups. This book is really a paper engineering marvel. The pop-up bits are enormously detailed and full of movement. My favorite part is when the boy unwraps the mummy. Its an understatement to say the pop-ups are spectacular.The only reservation at all I have about this book is that my kids will probably love it to death. Like another reviewer I think Im going to buy them their own copy and keep one for myself!If you have the least interest in Sendak or pop-ups or think you might buy this book,17.0,18.0,Maurice SendakArthur YorinksMatthew Reinhart,ive been sendak junkie since kid his books have always been among very favorites im happy say theyre among kids favorites well also love popups so really excited learn about book must say expectations have been surpassedthe story line very simple young child looks his mommy encountering various monsters along way defeating them creative ways there only few written words book story pictures tell wonderful what child wouldnt delighted book which kid defeats wolfman pantsing him nosferatu gets binky theres ton detail pictures well girls like spend several minutes looking each page spreadthen there popups book really paper engineering marvel popup bits enormously detailed full movement favorite part when boy unwraps mummy understatement say popups spectacularthe only reservation all have about book kids probably love death like another reviewer think im going buy them own copy keep one myselfif have least interest sendak or popups or think might buy book

The Man in the Black Suit - 3 starsThis is a story about a 9-year-old boy who meets the Devil himself. Its a very scary experience for the boy especially because his older brother died the year before and now the Devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way.This is the weakest of the four stories because the Devil although being scary doesnt really come across as a serious threat. What kind of second-rate Devil is it that cant even catch a boy who decides to run away from him?In Everythings Eventual Stephen King writes that this story won a prestigious best short story award in 1996 much to his surprise. That surprises me too because in my opinion this story is not that great.All That You Love Will Be Carried Away - 5 starsThis is the shortest story (only 35 minutes) and one of the two best ones in this collection. Alfie Zimmer is a traveling salesman in the American Midwest. He has an amazing hobby and hes tired of life. But if he commits suicide what will everyone think of his hobby?What makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives. Alfies strange hobby is also captivating as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren Midwest.In Everythings Eventual Stephen King admits that Alfies strange hobby was actually something he did himself!The Death of Jack Hamilton - 4 starsThis is a very unusual story for Stephen King. It tells a mythical story about the 1934 death of Jack Hamilton member of the John Dillinger gang. Homer Van Meter another gang member purportedly tells the story.John Dillinger Jack Hamilton and Homer Van Meter were all real people.

Pauly avid reader,Midwest,Every page is an eye opener.  The author has done an excellent job revealing the side of Hillary that has so long been hidden. I think America could do better by picking a different first woman president. Someone with some morals and a love of our country. She has neither. It is an important first that should withstand the test of time. Historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in. Her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character. Her child was always placed last. The only time Hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light.How did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time?  They did not even own property when they became president.  There are still a lot of questions to be answered and many more books to be written about this family. 8 years of these two is quite enough. ,10.0,13.0,Edward Klein,every page eye opener author done excellent job revealing side hillary so long been hidden think america could do better picking different first woman president someone some morals love our country she neither important first should withstand test time historians going have field day writing all trash two involved her mothering skills reveal great deal about her character her child always placed last only time hillary showed any family unity when necessary media put her positive lighthow did two gain so much wealth such short amount time did not even own property when became president there still lot questions answered many more books written about family 8 years two quite enough

1206,0006530702:insightful_and_timely:richard_stoehr_differed_from,6530702,From Beirut to Jerusalem: Books: Thomas Friedman,books,5,Insightful and timely,September 5 2006,Richard Stoehr Differed From,Bremerton WA USA,Ive been staring at a copy of Thomas Friedmans From Beirut to Jerusalem on my shelf for nearly a year now meaning to read it but always drawn to something else.  Finally recent events demanded that I learn more and I finally pulled it down dusted it off and read it.  Im so glad I did especially now.The book is not the easiest read since it delves into a lot of regional history and politics which gets complex no matter what you do.  Friedmans writing style however goes a long way towards making the text quite accessible for just about anyone and his unique perspective on the events that he witnessed and covered in his role as a journalist keeps it interesting and always relevant.What I really appreciated about the way Friedman presents his story is that it really is HIS story.  He is obviously a man gifted with a keen sense of observation and so he picks up on many details others might miss such as the faces of Israeli soldiers or the opinions of Lebanese taxi drivers.  But still the story is told mainly through events he observed directly -- he just happened to be there for many of the events that shaped the Middle East as it is today.  He tells it in both large and small terms from some of the politicians he met and interviewed to discussions he had with neighbors and colleagues while living in the region.  The result is that you get the broad spectrum of what was going on in the region particularly in the 1980s a critical decade of events.I also appreciated Friedmans fairness throughout the book. From his perspective on the Lebanese government to the Palestinian intifada to the Israeli occupation to the American involvement in the region he deals with all of the players fairly whether big or small famous or unknown.  Thats not to say he doesnt have criticisms -- certainly he has plenty to say about everyone...but one is never left with the feeling that he has been too harsh on one side and lenient on the other. ,1.0,2.0,Thomas Friedman,ive been staring copy thomas friedmans beirut jerusalem shelf nearly year now meaning read always drawn something else finally recent events demanded learn more finally pulled down dusted off read im so glad did especially nowthe book not easiest read since delves into lot regional history politics which gets complex no matter what do friedmans writing style however goes long way towards making text quite accessible just about anyone his unique perspective events witnessed covered his role journalist keeps interesting always relevantwhat really appreciated about way friedman presents his story really his story obviously man gifted keen sense observation so picks up many details others might miss such faces israeli soldiers or opinions lebanese taxi drivers still story told mainly through events observed directly just happened there many events shaped middle east today tells both large small terms some politicians met interviewed discussions had neighbors colleagues while living region result get broad spectrum what going region particularly 1980s critical decade eventsi also appreciated friedmans fairness throughout book his perspective lebanese government palestinian intifada israeli occupation american involvement region deals all players fairly whether big or small famous or unknown thats not say doesnt have criticisms certainly plenty say about everyonebut one never left feeling been too harsh one side lenient other

When the first man is released three people become a target as he follows through with the game.The first in a trilogy Dead Wrong gets it dead right. Mara Douglas is on one of the mens list and its up to Aidan Shields to protect her. While the book is decidedly light on the traditional sex part of a romantic suspense it is implied. I liked both characters and Aidan avoids being the atypical surly alpha male with surprising charm and affection.I cant wait for Dead Certain which follows the second man as he is released from jail and takes up the gauntlet thrown down by the first man.

The examples are all easy to relate to and I found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text. When I think of crowds I think of unthinking masses moving together led by tradition habit or an individual.  How can that be wise?  A more accurate title would be How some groups of people can make better decisions than experts while others act like collective idiots and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups although thats hardly likely to sell as many copies. :-) For me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work.  Id sometimes wondered why Ive been on a few teams that appeared to click (smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal) but our results werent great whereas other teams have been successful.  What was it that made a good team?  I had some of the pieces felt I still had some real gaps in my knowledge.  This book certainly helped. To paraphrase the basic idea that I took away from the book teams of people can achieve superior results if: 1 Each individual on the team is well informed;  2 The work of one individual does not influence the work of another;  3 There is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion. As simple as they sound there are many ways to fail and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure.,5.0,5.0,James Surowiecki,author james surowiecki lays out explores variety general specific cases groups people acting either wisely or stupidly examples all easy relate found them raise meaningful questions mind which answered due course text when think crowds think unthinking masses moving together led tradition habit or individual how can wise more accurate title would how some groups people can make better decisions than experts while others act like collective idiots what characteristics distinguish two types groups although thats hardly likely sell many copies really shed some light past experiences participating successful unsuccessful teams work id sometimes wondered why ive been few teams appeared click smart people who want work together achieve common goal our results werent great whereas other teams have been successful what made good team had some pieces felt still had some real gaps knowledge book certainly helped paraphrase basic idea took away book teams people can achieve superior results if 1 each individual team well informed 2 work one individual does not influence work another 3 there objective method aggregate individual conclusions into group conclusion simple sound there many ways fail book does great job exploring variety phenomena cause failure

As with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot circa 2000-04 of those events.  But there are two significant underlying assumption in this book: First as the single greatest world power the US will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has long-term impact to its strategic goals such as Europe throughout the entire Cold War Southeast Asia in the 60s & 70s and in the Middle East today.  Second US historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world.  Rather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the US & Europe the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current US foreign policy in the Middle East plays itself out over the next few decades.  Is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world? Stay tuned.It is a well-written quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights.   ,1.0,1.0,Robert Kagan,good highlevel analysis current us vs european international relations written conservative perspective any book covering fluid world events book can only provide snapshot circa 200004 events there two significant underlying assumption book first single greatest world power us project power decades any region world feels longterm impact strategic goals such europe throughout entire cold war southeast asia 60s 70s middle east today second us historically viewed itself proponent spread liberal democracy through out world rather than focusing snipping back forth between us europe two major assumptions book could serve litmus test observe how current us foreign policy middle east plays itself out over next few decades merely current political view or historic shift strategic focus different region world stay tunedit wellwritten quick read meaningful subcontextual insights

Soehnlein,books,5,Packs an emotional wallop,January 1 2006,krebsman,New York NY United States,In some ways KM Soehnleins THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS reminded me of the teenage novels of Paul Zindel.  There is that same depth of feeling along with characters that can break your heart and make you laugh at the same time.  Zindel wrote specifically for adolescents.  Soehnlein does not have those restrictions and has written a brutally honest book about homosexual experimentation among post-pubescent boys and its social implications.  Although the book is written for adults it speaks on a deep personal level to the adolescent in all of us.THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS is the story of a family that falls apart when a tragic accident befalls the youngest child.  The story is seen through the eyes of the victims 13-year-old brother as he tries to find something to hold on to while his mother drifts into alcoholism his father goes nuts his sister becomes a religious fanatic (and a kleptomaniac) and he finds himself smitten with two boys.  One is Todd the athletic and arrogant brother of his girl-pal confidante who lives next door.  The other is Scott a boy who deals drugs cuts school and has an alcoholic father who beats him.  All the characters are vividly rendered.  If this were ever turned into a film the actress who plays the mother would probably win an Oscar just for her final scene in the car.This is powerful and emotional writing.  I found it very moving.  Its tempting to want to recommend this book to a wide audience but I am reticent because there are several scenes of furtive and unacknowledged sex between teenage boys that could upset some people.But I will never forget this book.

Romano dances with cats,Israel,This is a book about beauty passion a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts especially music craves and feels the fire that burns within. A book that dares to take one if one dares to take that step on a journey deep into the bare souls of its characters. The story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot or develops into dramatic changes for the characters. That is not what the author wanted to convey and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity and not expect the characters to travel actively without. The book gives us these people the town the surroundings. It brings us deep into the realities the thoughts the complexities of the human soul. The people are good bad ugly beautiful selfish depressed found or lost. But from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in Mick Kellys soul and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town then the author reveals her own soul with her words for those that pick up on what her words show. I am still amazed at the power this book has. Any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous.

The author Jeff Shaara did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his fathers book THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father. GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott Robert E. Lee Stonewall Jackson Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.

On page 16 he writes: A foreign stranger visiting the Oxford campus is shown libraries department buildings and museums. Then he asks But where is the University?. This is the category mistake. Cartesian question Where is the mind? has a same confusion he asserts. A famous epigram Ghost in the Machine is sometimes misinterpreted. His point is that there is NO ghost. What we think ghost (spirit) does not exist (therefore ghost!).Although the philosophy of ordinary language and the logical behaviorism the British school represented by Wittgenstein and Ryle had an its apogee in 50s its crux of reasoning still has an important element. I still feel the current dominant school in cognitive science such as functionalism has a long way to go before it can make it acceptable for broader spectrum of scientists whose prime mode of thinking is purely materialistic or physicalistic. ,4.0,7.0,Ryle                         G,gilbert ryle shows great skill condensing his whole argument succinct metaphor page 16 writes foreign stranger visiting oxford campus shown libraries department buildings museums then asks where university category mistake cartesian question where mind same confusion asserts famous epigram ghost machine sometimes misinterpreted his point there no ghost what think ghost spirit does not exist therefore ghostalthough philosophy ordinary language logical behaviorism british school represented wittgenstein ryle had apogee 50s crux reasoning still important element still feel current dominant school cognitive science such functionalism long way go before can make acceptable broader spectrum scientists whose prime mode thinking purely materialistic or physicalistic

The main reason to me is that Ryle clarifies the concept of being human while he uses language in a natural way. In stead of constructing concepts based on (for  example scientific) assumptions he shows what we already see as obvious  just by pointing out what we mean with our ordinary language. He is far  from reductionistic; mark the subtle irony: Man need not be degraded to a  machine by being denied to be a ghost in a machine. He might after all be  a sort of animal namely a higher mammal. There has yet to be ventured the  hazardous leap to the hypothesis that perhaps he is a man.,7.0,10.0,Ryle                         G,concept mind great book several reasons main reason ryle clarifies concept being human while uses language natural way stead constructing concepts based example scientific assumptions shows what already see obvious just pointing out what mean our ordinary language far reductionistic mark subtle irony man need not degraded machine being denied ghost machine might after all sort animal namely higher mammal there yet ventured hazardous leap hypothesis perhaps man

Shirer,books,4,Remarkable work,September 13 2006,Scott Walker,Fort Atkinson Wisconsin,By a hypnotism that defies explanation--at least by a non-German--Hitler held the allegiance and trust of this remarkable people to the last.  It was inevitable that they would follow him blindly like dumb cattle but also with a touching faith and even an enthusiasm that raised them above the animal herd over the precipice to the destruction of the nation.This remarkable book is based principally on the captured German documents the interrogations and testimony at the Nuremberg trials of German military officers and civilian officials the diaries and memoirs which some of them have left and on Shirers experience in the Third Reich.  Shirer became one of the most respected journalists in wartime Europe.The book is exhaustive and detailed with extensive notes and bibliography.  A bit of patience is needed to get through the dialect often quoting Mein Kampf.  Shirer brings forth wonderful descriptions of the people who played a role in those troubled times.  The individual battles are not detailed so one will need to refer to other sources for a more detailed look at these battles and horrors that ensued.  This is an important book for those interested in Germany and life in the Third Reich at this time. The Reich rises with a quick run through of Hitlers youth and the German history then the politics and Hitlers megalomania that led to national socialism and the rise to dictatorship.  The Treaty of Versais and the fall of the mark lead to Germanys economic fall allowing for the people to welcome in a dictatorship a new messiah by deceit.  The military buildup could now begin.   The coups to overthrow Hitler and the Nazis had already failed and will continue to fail throughout the war.  For the officers it was either death by Hitler or death by fighting.

Im truly glad I did; The Witness was a first-rate thriller!The villains in this book are greasy sick individuals that rather turned my stomach...just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life! Sandra Brown wrote these characters (and that of Ricki Sue-who I could easily picture!) particularly well. The baby was truly the icing on the cake: this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and like any mother lived for the love of her child.I also loved the sexy romantic element here-it was just enough that it didnt overwhelm the story...even better it didnt change Kendall into a mindless goober (a state which many female characters in romance novels often achieve.)The Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating. Perhaps it was the Crooks...they came off a bit cliche but were still necessary characters.Still this book is an excellent thought-provoking choice with a WOW ending.

A time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and Claire has to leave her beloved daughter Brianna behind. This trip is successful and Claire is now plunged into the complicated life of Jamie who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the post-uprising difficulties of the Scottish.  While Claire is involved with the difficulties of her re-union with Jamie there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in Edinborough and the kidnapping of Jamies nephew.  Claire and Jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates voodoo and slave uprisings in the Caribbean.This colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have Claire and Jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period.  Nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by Gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple.  One of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured; the giggling bouncy foot-worshipping Chinaman Mr. Willoughby.  Although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring.  A note I think the story would have been better without.   Despite its flaws Voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise.  The time travel fantasy is portrayed well--in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the 18th century if all you could carry was in your pockets.  Combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest.

1249,0813390656:how_do_you_want_to_interpret_consciousness?:s._alex,813390656,Minds of Their Own: Thinking and Awareness in Animals: Books: Lesley J. Rogers,books,4,How do you want to interpret consciousness?,August 15 2006,S. Alex,Northfield OH,Until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions. As Rogers clearly points out most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon.  An inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors. In the early 1600s Spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance. He told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center. Antonio Damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness. Using Damasio and Spinoza as a frame of reference it follows that each and every decision we make is based on an emotion not a uniquely quantifiable language infused thought as the popular human interpretation might assume. Examples of this might be choosing the color of paint a selection from a menu the selection of a mate or which way to turn when unsure. Animals have provided us with an exhaustive and document able list of emotional behaviors. How is it possible to arrive at the conclusion that animals are not conscious when most animals will clearly display behaviors consistent with emotional stimulus? The last frontier of computer science is the quest for a conscious non-human entity. Ray Kurzweil has spent the better part of his life predicting the emergence of an exponentially accelerating form of machine augmented human consciousness. In my view  it would be safer to assume that at some point technology will provide us with means to understand the different levels of consciousness that exist. While computers struggle to redefine consciousness by passing Turing,1.0,1.0,Lesley J.

Nishimoto Golden Lion,USA,The new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things: ideas information and relationships and is intensely interlinked.   Today the new information based sector occupies over 15% of the total US economy.  In the postindustrial society communication has become the economy and the cultural technological and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives.   The financial sector has reshaped the economy; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people;  the financial innovations include: mortgages insurance venture funding stocks checks credit cards and mutual funds; the financial sector has given rise to corporations market capitalism the industrial age and has influenced how all business has been done.  Since communication is the economy the net is the future.  The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission; the net is weaving lives minds and artifacts into a global scale network; the result is the swarm of information reticulating the surface of the planet; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works.  In 1997 there were 6 billion non-computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion.The network represents connectivity.  We are connection everything to everything.  The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results; and we dont need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system.   The network is a link of distributed bottom up data bits;   it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication for example manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests as they bid on work dependant on their capability.

Well its a little of both and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time. Most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words captions or picture components. By figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics crossword puzzles or other word grids the cartoon humor is revealed. For the most part the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty although there are a few difficult ones (at least for me) that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonists career. Frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from Games Magazine and other media that Puzzability publishes in. The foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between New Yorker cartoon editor Robert Mankoff and New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz.This is an entertaining book that youll hate to throw away when its been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains.

As a young Chinese woman Winnie Louie the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu a pretentious arrogant and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder but also committed numerous felons including rape murder blackmailing and extortion. Day after day beating after beating Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love radical and immediate actions must be taken. When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency someone like Wen Fu the usual traditional and orthodox actions are futile. Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself. Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty. Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations regardless of race nationality or social status.

PollanMark Levine,books,5,Hard hitting truths about the real world of work!,November 10 2006,Todd,Tulsa OK,Imagine youre attending a career enhancement seminar and suddenly youre doused with a giant bucket of ice cold water. In essence Fire Your Boss is just that. Stephen Pollans discourse on the stark realities of the real world of work shatter all the hyperbole and fluff of careering in not just corporate America but any occupational arena. Its an easy conversational and straightforward read that IMHO should be called Hire Your Boss. Pollan a life coach with the style chutzpah and hubris of a Donald Trump/Scott Adams hybrid elaborates on the criticality of taking care of your number one customer in the microeconomic marketplace-your boss. Pollan supports the essence of this approach with references to how the economic landscape has changed over the last few decades and how its helped to perpetuate agency activity in organizations. Simply put managers will continue to act purely out of self-interest rather than an alignment with organizational objectives. With this in mind what will avail those of the non-management cadre the most is looking out for the needs of supervision with more of a hired gun approach rather than that of a sycophant. Many of Pollans precepts will at first seem counterintuitive--such as work for the money the love will follow or lose your career get a job and may come across as trite and cynical. However when taken in context the underlying schema is this: a job is a means of providing income-no more no less. Trying to find personal fulfillment therein is a recipe for self-destruction. The author does a fine job of using the experiences of his clients to help illustrate these key concepts and concludes by offering a seven-step roadmap to help one achieve the empowerment and independence in the modern job market. Although Pollan drives across some salient points about the contemporary world of work he does tend to oversimplify a bit with regards to some management behavior.

It did take me more than a year of picking at it on and off. I picked it up because Walter Laqueur referred to it in one of his books about terrorism. Written in 1886 it suggests that there is a pan-European anarchist underground which the protagonist gets mixed up with. It is interesting in its depiction of liberal guilt among the wealthy who support a political movement that would lead to their own extinction. The prose is wonderful as is the depiction of the subtleties of the characters personalities if you have the taste for that sort of thing. All in all it was worth reading and it passed the most important test for a novel: I finished it with regret. I had previously read and liked Portrait of a Lady which is a superior novel. As much as I liked it I would have to say do not start with Princess as an introduction to James. Incidentally I have a theory about the omniscient narrator in James books being a malign demiurge but I will spare you that theorizing here,5.0,6.0,Henry JamesDerek BrewerPatricia Crick,liked book notice all critics seem hate did take more than year picking off picked up because walter laqueur referred one his books about terrorism written 1886 suggests there paneuropean anarchist underground which protagonist gets mixed up interesting depiction liberal guilt among wealthy who support political movement would lead own extinction prose wonderful depiction subtleties characters personalities if have taste sort thing all all worth reading passed most important test novel finished regret had previously read liked portrait lady which superior novel much liked would have say do not start princess introduction james incidentally have theory about omniscient narrator james books being malign demiurge spare theorizing here

1270,0385240872:confusing_hilarious_profound:dr_rizz,385240872,Lost in the Funhouse (The Anchor Literary Library): Books: John Barth,books,5,Confusing Hilarious Profound,June 4 2006,dr_rizz,seattle,Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you arent in the right mood for it.  If you arent well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme calvino etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first.  Even Barths novels are more immediately digestible.With that said though this collection doesnt really operate on one consistent level.  Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career.  The three stories concerning Ambroses birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular Lost in the Funhouse story (which Barth is probably most known for).  From that point on most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader writer and the characters.  Stories like Title and Life-Story work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction and were (for me at least) a little tedious.  The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation typically based on Greek mythology.  The best of these are the utterly raunchy Petitition and the labyrinthine Menelaiad.Taken as a whole though Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through.  Its the sort of book Ill go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor.Oh and make sure to read Barths seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after youve read the story that is being discussed in each note so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barths intentions.  I cant even imagine appreciating a story like Glossolalia ,,,John Barth,lost funhouse can very bewildering irritating collection if arent right mood if arent wellversed postmodern fiction barthelme calvino etc good reference points might want start somewhere else first even barths novels more immediately digestiblewith said though collection doesnt really operate one consistent level perhaps because many stories written barth much earlier his career three stories concerning ambroses birth development very straightforward enjoyable surface level until whole series goes flying into leftfield titular lost funhouse story which barth probably most known point most stories more about process writing relationship between reader writer characters stories like title lifestory work more essays nature fiction than actual works fiction least little tedious best moments occur when barth combines his thoughful analysis nature writing art really good groundsituation typically based greek mythology best utterly raunchy petitition labyrinthine menelaiadtaken whole though lost funhouse greatly satisfying even if like really only understood about 20 what barth talking about first readthrough sort book ill go back again again try delve deeper into mystery funhouse while appreciating all over hilarious bawdy humoroh make sure read barths seven additional notes front book though maybe only after youve read story being discussed each note so not ruin initial experience really help clarify some barths intentions cant even imagine appreciating story like glossolalia

For example he considers how common phrases such as &quot;go up to the attic&quot; and &quot;go down to the basement&quot; are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends--in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended.  As he does with other such observations Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives.  In addition to exploring how we experience space and place Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight; roughly speaking he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something.  By reading this beautifully written and engaging book you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived grown up felt comfortable or alienated had a feeling of wonder or fear etc.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space in language and what it can reveal to us or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language,65.0,67.0,Gaston Bachelard,though may not immediately think there connection between language places where live pass through sense surroundings language itself transformed after read gaston bachelards quotthe poetics spacequot bachelard argues languageespecially poetrycan reveal hidden aspects our experience space especially our home space example considers how common phrases such quotgo up atticquot quotgo down basementquot revelatory our typical sense stairs attic stairs one ascends while stairs basement stairs one descendsin spite fact both sets stairs must equally ascended descended does other such observations bachelard extends his observation regarding directionality different staircases into discussion how attic basement hold different roles our daily imaginary lives addition exploring how experience space place bachelard equally attends way which language can function either daily common means communication or site new creative insight roughly speaking argues poetry happens when motions language itself open us up new way seeing or understanding something reading beautifully written engaging book likely come understand or see anew experiences childhood through adulthood pertain places where have lived grown up felt comfortable or alienated had feeling wonder or fear etc recommend book anyone interested experience place or space language what can reveal us or what counts poetry rather than common everyday language

1275,0345395379:top_notch_sf:cavan_terrill,345395379,Slow River: Books: Nicola Griffith,books,4,Top notch SF,January 25 2005,Cavan Terrill,Ottawa Canada,I was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of Nebula Award winners. This book is not at all your typical SF story indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some SF aspects than it does an SF story. Im an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction so this holds a good deal of appeal for me.Griffiths prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction. Her characterization is also near perfect. I wont spend time discussing the plot as thats been handled amply by the other reviewers but I will echo one other persons thoughts: The storyline that has Lore working at a sewage plant is surprisingly every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing. To me that says a good deal about Griffiths talent as a writer.As for the sex scenes which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book (not each but in total).

The light melodic fill is just that filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words. I found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book.  If you find the book to be what you are looking for the CDs are a good addition.

Maybe on some rainy first day of April?  I once felt like writing:I sure made a mistake when I told the Goddess Minerva that She couldnt square the circle.  In response She drew a circle next to me a truly beautiful and perfect circle.  And right in front of my panicky brown eyes She turned pi into four!  Not just the circumference divided by the diameter but the series expansion as an inverse tangent as well.  What would She do next make me unwell by dropping the first letter from my first name?  i tried to apologize but it was too late.  I was not the only one to dream of mangling pi.  In Contact: A Novel Carl Sagan went me one better when he had aliens send messages to each other at infinite speed by hiding them in a numerical representation of pi and then you guessed it changing pi everywhere!Still Alan Sokal went beyond even this getting the following published in the journal Social Text:In this way the infinite-dimensional invariance group erodes the distinction between the observer and the observed; the pi of Euclid and the G of Newton formerly thought to be constant and universal are now perceived in their ineluctable historicity; and the putative observer becomes fatally decentered disconnected from any epistemic link to a spacetime point that can no longer be defined by geometry alone.  Sokal put this and many more whoppers into his hoax which defended an equally absurd thesis: that physical reality no less than social reality is at bottom a social and linguistic construct.  While this joke may not prove much it does raise the issue of whether a few people in academia are misusing the vocabulary of science to create absurd statements in defense of an antirationalist point of view.  This book shows that they are.

Noonans Reagan is not hagiography;  its clear-eyed clean and palpably honest.  I feel Ms. Noonans honesty just as I felt the incredible lightness of Reeves shallowness.   Noonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as Ronald Reagan lay dying.  Now that hes gone Peggy Noonan is our eras great communicator.  Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words dont fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower. Noonan I believe is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first-term footnote an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or like Reeves has learned to diminish.  Thats the PATCO strike which as Noonan shows had world-historical implications.  By the force of his focus President Reagan used PATCO to reassert free-world mastery in our twilight struggle with an Evil Empire that was evil and that was an empire.

Japanese Series): Books: Yukio Mishima,books,5,An absolute masterpiece,February 24 2006,Zack Davisson,Ikeda Osaka Japan,Spring Snow is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right.  It is an eloquent moving story with a tale as old as time that of star-crossed lovers whos love transcends social roles and obligations.In another culture with another writer this would be a romantic if not happy story.  But this is Japan and the writer is Mishima Yukio.  In his hands the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes and become agents of their own happiness and destruction.  By the very nature of their relationship raised together since childhood playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension their future is never in doubt.  It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams could craft such a tender love story.  While knowing the eventual conclusion the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared.    Not that it is a clear path.  Even knowing Japanese literature and the road it usually takes there are surprises on the way.  Things do not turn out the way one would expect.  I was incredibly moved by Spring Snow.  It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader and lingers long after the last page is turned. ,5.0,5.0,Yukio Mishima,spring snow unquestionably one finest japanese novels ever written well being masterpiece world literature own right eloquent moving story tale old time starcrossed lovers whos love transcends social roles obligationsin another culture another writer would romantic if not happy story japan writer mishima yukio his hands lovers kiyoaki satoko transcend literary stereotypes become agents own happiness destruction very nature relationship raised together since childhood playing complicated catandmouse game love sexual tension future never doubt impressive writer such mishima known his rightwing politics his samurai dreams could craft such tender love story while knowing eventual conclusion reader savors hopes each stolen moment happiness between kiyoaki satoko knows even despair something treasured because shared not clear path even knowing japanese literature road usually takes there surprises way things do not turn out way one would expect incredibly moved spring snow novel affects heart reader lingers long after last page turned

Shiller,books,5,Rational Analysis,October 9 2006,B.Sudhakar Shenoy,BangaloreIndia,I read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market. The phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half. The raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns. Bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the new era story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay. But as shown by proven evidence of the past no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later. When this happens the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible. The story so far is quite simple. But what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained.The combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book. For bubbles to happen information flow is the key. Media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media. In recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals. Media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis. Stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try ones luck if a casino is far away. Backed by on-line dedicated news channels and internet trading well it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds. In such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and P/E ratios take a backseat as explained by the author.

He uses history but is not a historicist for  he lets the works reveal themselves openly.

Wright,books,5,level headed reading: Jesus in his own context,July 25 2006,David Stump,,in order to properly understand the Jesus of the new testament instead of making a Jesus of our own liking it is necessary to understand Jesus as he himself indicated.  Jesus himself according to the new testament made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures ( old testament ) as he sought to explain himself his actions his teachings and his significance.  Understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what Jesus was and is about. This means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about Noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews.  Understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole.  Christopher Wrights book Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament is an absolute Godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the Jesus of the new testament.  This book is a little bit technical at times it is not a devotional work but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of Jesus thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of Jesus according to the background that Jesus himself referred to.    Thanks Chris Wright for this fabulous book. Also see his forthcoming book The Mission of God due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press. It looks to be another bullseye!!

It wreaks havoc and sometimes kills as is the case with several people in this book.  The rest are either thought mad or driven mad.  Question:  If you could would you switch places with somebody else in a different time?  I think I might but I would like to be given a choice.  Brandy McCabe and her granddaughter Shay Garrett arent given that choice.  Both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each others bodies.Marlys Millhiser has woven a complex and fascinating story of culture shock in which Brandy becomes her granddaughter and Shay becomes her grandmother.  Shay is thought crazy in the early 1900s because she can tell the future and she keeps a diary to tell her grandmother how she has lived out her life should she return to her own body one day.  Her story and how she deals with a pre-citified Boulder Colorado is the most interesting segment of the book but I didnt feel sorry for Shay as much as I admired her strength of character.  She also had her mothers stories of her ancestors to go on but this was not the case for poor Brandy.  The Garretts and Shays fiancee dont know what to do with a pregnant Shay who is terrified and clueless about the year 1978 but they know after discovering the diary that she really is Brandy.  The story is often heartbreaking often times quite funny and there are so many supporting and unforgettable characters--like the lovable Thora K. Brandys first mother-in-law and the old man who takes care of Shay when she runs away from her family--that this book is not only compelling but also makes you think about your own place in this world.  What Shay and Brandy do have in common is Rachel Brandys daughter and Shays mother.  Now picture those two being in each others place when you think of that!

Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer that the magic hadnt ended. Despite its rather large size and intricate story the novel ended too soon for me. (I like big books but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) I finished this gem in three sittings. The novels setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife the American heiress Celia Taylor to his estate in Sussex England. There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. But something strange begins to happen between them. Celia is experiencing deja vu as though shed been there before. This happens the second she enters the castle. At the same time Richard becomes restless and moody. Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. There are many twists throughout the novel.I have ,21.0,21.0,Anya Seton,having read katherine wanted get hands another anya seton novel her words beautiful her accurate historical references medieval renaissance eras breathtaking people recommended green darkness because timeless romance historical feel paranormal aspects centered past lives reincarnation so gave green darkness whirl enormous book big trade paperback over sixhundred pages enthralled beginning end wish had been longer magic hadnt ended despite rather large size intricate story novel ended too soon like big books have make sure enjoy whole thing when getting large volume finished gem three sittings novels setting begins late 1960s around year first published richard mardson takes his beloved wife american heiress celia taylor his estate sussex england there shows her around ancient castle had belonged his noble family centuries introduces her his friends peers all respectable noblemen women like richard something strange begins happen between them celia experiencing deja vu though shed been there before happens second she enters castle same time richard becomes restless moody celia bewildered his abrupt change once loving man someone who isolates himself avoids her lives marriage could shambles celia go back her previous life during tudor england figure out what had gone wrong order salvage happiness present time her past life woman named celia bohun who falls handsome monk named stephen richard mardson forbidden love timeless things go through staggering there many twists throughout noveli have
1300,0553213970:vernes_vision_of_a_subterranean_world:sean_k,553213970,Journey to the Centre of the Earth (Classic): Books: Jules VerneKim Stanley Robinson,books,4,Vernes Vision of a Subterranean World,August 14 2006,Sean K,Anaheim CA,A Jules Vernes classic this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time.  True there are some items that may seem a bit dated and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible.  Yet this novel is still a joy to read.With a stoic Icelander as their guide a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist.  Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality) the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno.  I wont serve as spoiler but sufficed to say that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint.  Their instruments a crude electric light and others would be considered state-of-the art for their time.  Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth.  Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body.  And if you take Vernes theories to heart (although modern science refutes them) their journey is plausible.However I do have a couple minor gripes.  Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel.  Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line.  Also there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic.

1301,068486875X:exciting_and_provoking:toddinsf,068486875X,Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants Brains Cities and Software: Books: Steven Johnson,books,5,Exciting and provoking,August 5 2006,ToddInSF,San Francisco CA,  I was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here.  Even more stunned by the criticisms.  This is not a scientific treatise and never pretends to be.  This is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of Emergence nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper.  This is an interesting graspable exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely positively crucial to understand.  To some people Emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field - those people were disappointed and found this light reading - which is really too bad because they are the ones who NEED this book the most.  Alas we can expect it to be a while before these scientist can look outside their own shallow mud-puddles of their over-specialties to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in both natural and man-made.   If you didnt find this book exciting you didnt read it.  Sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice.  Let Johnson do what he does best; take you on a journey of ideas and concepts.  Sure some of it is simplified for the lay-reader but anybody who isnt a total couch-potato is going to find the content interesting enough to set-out and search for details on their own.  It isnt Johnsons goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate.    His goal is to show what emergence IS and why it is SO important how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field and how elegant simple complex chaotic and BEAUTIFUL emergence IS !   And he does exactly this quite well.  If you read this book and are not excited you didnt get it.  Read it again.  And again.  Look up the examples of emergence and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in YOUR world in YOUR daily experience. ,5.0,7.0,Steven Johnson,stunned see so many critical reviews book here even more stunned criticisms not scientific treatise never pretends not introduction into more abstract obscure aspects emergence nor dry tedious mathematical paper interesting graspable exciting intelligently written book about phenomenon which absolutely positively crucial understand some people emergence particular abstract particular field people disappointed found light reading which really too bad because ones who need book most alas can expect while before scientist can look outside own shallow mudpuddles overspecialties see how applicable emergent theory world immersed both natural manmade if didnt find book exciting didnt read sit down read without distraction prejudice let johnson do what does best take journey ideas concepts sure some simplified layreader anybody who isnt total couchpotato going find content interesting enough setout search details own isnt johnsons goal elaborate some trivial fragmentary specialty only people masters degrees secured positions academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate his goal show what emergence why so important how vast concepts potential application every imaginable field how elegant simple complex chaotic beautiful emergence does exactly quite well if read book not excited didnt get read again again look up examples emergence try actually find own examples emergence world daily experience

Goonan www.meaningful-life.us,Pleasanton CA,This is in my opinion John Bradshaws best book. It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions addictions co-dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes.In this volume John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families. He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics.Through affirmations working with feelings visualizations and other techniques the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame. As someone who has done the work himself he comes across as compassionate knowledgeable and very practical.Sometimes I get annoyed when I read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts. This is the explanation for my 4 rating along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content. Therefore my overall rating is that this is a solid well-written classic that certainly deserves its best-seller status. However prepare yourself for some repetition and unnecessarily long examples of what he is talking about.,4.0,4.0,John Bradshaw,opinion john bradshaws best book encapsulates his thinking area toxic shame demonstrates how phenomenon core compulsions addictions codependencies our need achieve beyond what really necessary or serves our larger purposesin volume john bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops leads breakdown families also talks about how cycle perpetuated through generations actually covers lot ground terms family dynamicsthrough affirmations working feelings visualizations other techniques author shows reader how work through toxic shame someone who done work himself comes across compassionate knowledgeable very practicalsometimes get annoyed when read book because unnecessary repetition some key concepts explanation 4 rating along fact many his books overlap each other respect content therefore overall rating solid wellwritten classic certainly deserves bestseller status however prepare yourself some repetition unnecessarily long examples what talking about

I love this series and it absolutely pains me to think that this may be the last (I say maybe because originally Buddies was supposed to be the last).  It is such a difficult book to pick up and read because every emotion invested in the previous three books is tested.  My love for Dennis Savages irony becomes sorrow at the hope that he will lose face and stay with Little Kiwi.  My love for Little Kiwis innocence becomes concern for his actions.  Its like watching your child make questionable decisions and knowing that no matter what the result the choices that they make are theirs and theres nothing you can do about it but let them be chosen.  Its hard letting Little Kiwi grow up and become Virgil Brown.  I imagine its the same way with a child but at least then you get to see what happens!  Mind you the book like the other three is a comic genius with subtle feeling humor that has you laughing one minute and crying the next.  But just like &quot;Just Above My Head&quot; by James Baldwin (which I highly recommend) I have been unable to pick up this book and read it again.

1316,1400078377:please_translate_more_of_kirinos_work_into_english!:c._johnson,1400078377,Out: A Novel: Books: Natsuo Kirino,books,5,Please translate more of Kirinos work into English!,April 5 2006,C. Johnson,Orange County California,On the surface Natsuo Kirino gives us a book loaded with nail-biting page turning suspense.  What lies beneath is a scathing commentary on the social climate for women in Japan.  Women are seen as beautiful young pets or useless old bags.  Kirino shows a side of Japan that I didnt know existed.Kirinos brilliant characterization makes this book work.  Every person is fleshed out within the context of the story and flashbacks are only used when absolutely necessary.  I never felt like the story was on hold while I learned about someones childhood.  I cant stand it when writers stop a story cold just to fill in holes that they have created.  Kirino doesnt have that problem.The book has a bit of a slow start but it is necessary for the author to paint a picure of the mundane world the characters live in before things start to heat up.  The story picks up momentum and charges through to a brilliant ending (I have to disagree with other reviewers who disliked the ending. If you dont like the ending you may be missing the point of the whole book). The plot twists manage to surprise the reader without feeling forced. Kirinos style is concise and well-paced.My one complaint is that it is difficult to keep the characters straight because of their similar names.  With names like Yayoi Yoshie and Yoko its hard to know whos who at times.  This may show my American ignorance but I have to admit that this was a problem for me.This minor complaint aside I loved this book and I highly recommend it to all fans of crime fiction,3.0,4.0,Natsuo Kirino,surface natsuo kirino gives us book loaded nailbiting page turning suspense what lies beneath scathing commentary social climate women japan women seen beautiful young pets or useless old bags kirino shows side japan didnt know existedkirinos brilliant characterization makes book work every person fleshed out within context story flashbacks only used when absolutely necessary never felt like story hold while learned about someones childhood cant stand when writers stop story cold just fill holes have created kirino doesnt have problemthe book bit slow start necessary author paint picure mundane world characters live before things start heat up story picks up momentum charges through brilliant ending have disagree other reviewers who disliked ending if dont like ending may missing point whole book plot twists manage surprise reader without feeling forced kirinos style concise wellpacedmy one complaint difficult keep characters straight because similar names names like yayoi yoshie yoko hard know whos who times may show american ignorance have admit problem methis minor complaint aside loved book highly recommend all fans crime fiction

Ibadov,New Jersey,Among all the theories of ethics with which I am familiar I have always found Kants system to be the best: carrying out ones duty for the sake of the duty itself. The problem with Kant however is that his theory of morality is grounded outside humanity dependent on a source of which we can never some may claim have any understanding. Christine Korsgaard fixes at least for me this problem by showing that one does not have to venture outside humanity in order to ground its morality. In short the source of normativity is our humanity itself.I dont want to get into too much details and give away the main points of the book. Suffice it to say that it offers in my opinion some of the best arguments for the objectivity of morality. The conclusion I reached after reading the book was this: It is as much justified for a human to complain Why should I be moral? as it is for him/her to complain Why should I have two eyes? In both cases the answer is Because you are a human being a social animal with two eyes.,2.0,3.0,Christine M.

Most works that I have read from the nineteenth century are long-winded purple-toned velvet-like effluviums. This one is short and for once I would have liked a book a bit wordier.Anyhow the narrator a sort of mad tinkerer describes his visit 800000+ years to the future. He finds two distinct inheritors of the human race: one smallish simple-minded but joyful class of vegetarian people that live on the surface of the Earth (the Eloi) and one larger brute-like class of photophobic ground dwellers that perform most of the work for the Eloi but unfortunately also eat them. Gone are most of the trappings of modern society. Humans have devolved into beautiful idiots and those that prey upon them.   Darwins theories of evolution and natural selection were just beginning to take hold at the time Wells was writing and they obviously influence the work. I read somewhere that Wells took a university course taught by the biologist T.H. Huxley who highly regarded Darwins theories. Socialism also influences the book with the Morlock underclass literally kept in the dark until they devolve into creatures that cannot tolerate light and have to rely on human flesh for food. Part of socialist theory is conflict theory; so instead of cannibalizing their own the Morlocks eat the Eloi as a sort of vengeance.Darkness and the use of the dark as something mysterious from out which monsters may jump is Gothic old hat for early writers of this genre. Wells uses the dark as the place where the Morlocks are banished and where the Time-traveler believes the Morlocks have his stolen time machine.

Sure there are some outrageous stories and some things may seem unlikely to some people. They are lucky I guess. I for one can really relate to the dysfunctional family and to a lot of the characters.  But it isnt meant to be a character study or some huge philosophy assignment.

According to this mom of three grown children the five key elements of a great family begin with love -- expressions that inspire and comfort; fun -- activities that recharge a familys batteries; loyalty -- lessons on sticking with family through it all; growth -- embracing new challenges and seeing the value of stretching; and faith -- holding close a relationship with Christ that shines vividly and practically into the lives of others. With many personal anecdotes fanciful stories and good common sense advice Kuykendall does a marvelous job presenting a handbook for parents that is easy on both the eyes and the heart.The authors two-part text deals with family matters that focus on the beginnings of new family life when a young couple first discovers theyre pregnant. Some of the practical points offered in this section include deciding who to invite to the actual delivery naming the baby by taking into account potential teasing/taunting as a result of this all-important choice hashing out basic parenting decisions regarding naps/nursing/discipline dealing with those unmet expectations that crop up almost immediately after giving birth and learning to fit into the extended family with the newest member without stepping on other siblings toes or feelings.Kuykendall then delves into dreaming for a bit.

He thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before I start my career on Wall Street.  I was not disappointed.  The Five Keys is a very good summary of what I learned in business school and much much more.  The author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like Buffett and Graham.  The experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile; but what makes this book very special is the framework.  I have read several investment books over the years but none like this one.  Putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw.  In addition reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work.  The clarity in the concepts and the conversation-like tone was particularly attractive to me. In sum this is a very coherent practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective -- considering the authors strong unapologetic bias towards value investing,11.0,11.0,J.

R. Bird Ramseelbird,Manhattan NY,When I first started reviewing childrens books on Amazon.com I gave myself a long list of rules to follow.  And one of those rules stated that I was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until AFTER Id written my own review.  I wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure filled only with my own thoughts (which I obviously mistook to be brilliant) and feelings.  After a while though I gave up on this rule.  By and large (and this is not speaking for all reviews... just 90% of them) a review for a childrens book goes something along the lines of It was good my four-year-old requests it every night buy this book etc..  Nothing too shocking or revealing.  So I grew lazy.  I started reading other reviews of picture books long before I sat down to actually write a review of my own.  Just moments ago I went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book Martins Big Words.  This book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a Caldecott Honor years before.  So I went to the appropriate Amazon.com page (much as you are now) and read the first review on the list.  At the time it was an unassuming July 18 2002 review entitled Theres Something Wrong Here....  I read the review.  I digested the review.  And I came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones.  Ones that I should consider dare I say in my OWN review.  This is unprecedented.  Never has a review for a book a childrens book really hit home for me like this one did.  So to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002 I commend you.  And to myself a mental whipping for breaking my own rules.  Its a hard act to follow but Ive a point or two of my own to make and Im gonna make `em.

As he explores with brio this world he unfolds himself and as in most cross-cultural encounters this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book.

He gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits - which I regret - apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the Sheikhs of the places he visits. The descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how (extremely) fragile power was and is in those regions.

At last Paul Blustein has given us a look at the real-life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation. Here we have an in-depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of Argentinas economy in 2001-2002 which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship. You wont be surprised to see the word bubble regularly as Blustein covers the surprisingly slow-moving factors that added up to disaster over several years with many mistakes made by all parties along the way. In addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within Argentina itself Blustein also explains errors made by the IMF and the Clinton and Bush administrations and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions. Not to mention Argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure short-term rewards for speculators plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts. I would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters as Bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates international debt and equity markets and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply. If youre an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around,4.0,7.0,Paul Blustein,there many books out there about supposed strengths or weaknesses globalization free trade least terms international movement capital youll usually find mere boosterism ideology last paul blustein given us look reallife effects financial shenanigans speculation lives real people developing nation here have indepth incredibly informative examination global financial trends led horrendous collapse argentinas economy 20012002 which resulted millions millions people descending into poverty hardship wont surprised see word bubble regularly blustein covers surprisingly slowmoving factors added up disaster over several years many mistakes made all parties along way addition some financial mismanagement damaging internal politics within argentina itself blustein also explains errors made imf clinton bush administrations unhealthy speculation foreign investors who had no regard outcomes actions not mention argentina punching bag international monetary system built ensure shortterm rewards speculators plus ideology believes acceptable when elites rich countries profit while regular people developing nations left holding bag when bubble bursts would also recommend book general interest international monetary matters bluestein does marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates international debt equity markets other financial concepts may wish understand more deeply if youre ideologue love supposed panacea free markets thinking unfettered movement capital around

Walters Fond of Amazon,Connecticut,I found this book to very informative. In a nutshell it tells you how food is processed throughout your system and its reaction. Like fresh vegatables can be eaten with anything but starches dont digest well with meat. There are stages to going *Raw* that Ms. Rose has honestly and clearly put out there. Our bodies just cant go Raw over night. Yhere is a change in the digestive system. I know from my experience how my body feels when I eat raw for several days and then introduce the wrong combonation of foods. I feel like Im suffering at the toilet.Sorry. Natalie gets you through the stages of developing this life style. Its a Detox program not a cookbook. It has recipes for all the stages to going *Raw. Ms. Rose hershelf claims it took several years for her to go completely Raw. The recipes are for those various stages. I dont find anything wrong with this book. As far as enzymes. All foods have them and yes our body has them too. When cooking foods you are breaking down the enzymes that are packed with nutrients. That simple. We want to incorporate more enzymes or natural living food into our bodies. And if you read your Bible...you will know what it means to eat pure food. Eat what the Lord has provided for you. You best optimal health can continue and grow from eating more living foods. I was on this plan for a month. Without exercise I did the stage 3 and followed through the evening. I lost 16lbs in a month! I didnt even do an enema yet. My body was doing well everyday several times a day getting rid of the waste Ive manage to occumalate. I didnwant to wear my food anymore.

It wasnt Hiaasens best work but it was well beyond a lot of novels one could read.

Ordinarily this would be a cause for celebration but when one of the winners bemoans the fact that they have to share their spoils with another and they are wanna-be white supremists then the adventure starts.

Stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named Polly Danny struggles to complete his junior year. While home in New Jersey on a summer break Danny drives his fathers lunch wagon The Roach Coach. And this is how he meets Cindy a pleasant chatty secretary. Danny compares her to the girls on the Yale campus and the comparison is not flattering to Cindy. Hes faintly embarrassed by her and while shes ok to date when hes home in New Jersey hes ashamed of the relationship when he returns to Yale.Once again Perrotta presents the theme of escape from New Jersey and in the novel Dannys escape is temporarily through Yale but ultimately through education. Cindy represents everything Danny is trying to escape--a lifetime driving the Roach Coach and Danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in New Jersey. Class is another theme in the novel--during the school year Danny works in a cafeteria. The employees and the Townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out--whereas the Yale students seem to have vast limitless opportunities. While Dannys background is humble and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to Yale he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes. To them Yale doesnt quite hold the desperate stakes that face Danny. When it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices Danny nakedly examines his motives and simply shrugs. While this does not make Danny a heroic narrator it certainly makes him very real and very human. As a Perrotta fan I hope that the author rediscovers Danny in another novel.

C Gorham rcg2,AZ,THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals guitar) Kirk Hammett (guitars) Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion) and new member Jason Newsted (bass) formerly of Flotsam And Jetsam (replacing Cliff Burton R.I.P.). THE DISC: (1988) 9 tracks clocking in at approximately 65 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits song lyrics band pictures one gavel drawing containing  band member faces and thank yous. This is Metallicas 4th studio album. All songs written by Hetfield Hammett Ulrich and/or Newsted. Recorded at One On One Studios Los Angeles CA. This would be Flemming Rasmussens last album produced with the band (Bob Rock would follow). The Japanese (import) version contains a bonus track - a Diamond Head cover The Prince. Label - Elektra.COMMENTS: ...And Justice For All was the last classic Metallica album of the 80s. It was also their final attempt at thrash metal (once the 90s rolled around and producer Bob Rock entered the picture the band took a more mainstream metal approach). The majority of songs are long with complex riffs... borderline progressive. Let me first say that for years this disc sat on my shelf. I thought it was over-produced; I didnt like Ulrichs snare drum (sounded cheap and tinny) or his double bass (sounded shallow and metallic - partly due to a coin taped to the drum skin where the foot pedal hit); Newsteds bass was nonexistent (the standard explanation for this combines Newsteds absence from the mixing sessions where he could have voiced his opinion and the lingering issue of his newness within the band following the death of Burton); there were three songs that I just could not get into (Eye Of The Beholder The Shortest Straw and lightning fast Dyers Eve); and the articles I read about the 3 original band members hazing and not accepting newcomer Newsted was infuriating... call if fun call it pranks call it cruel - Newsted simply did not deserve,8.0,8.0,Metallica,band james hetfield lead vocals guitar kirk hammett guitars lars ulrich drums percussion new member jason newsted bass formerly flotsam jetsam replacing cliff burton rip disc 1988 9 tracks clocking approximately 65 minutes included disc 10page booklet containing song titlescredits song lyrics band pictures one gavel drawing containing band member faces thank yous metallicas 4th studio album all songs written hetfield hammett ulrich andor newsted recorded one one studios los angeles ca would flemming rasmussens last album produced band bob rock would follow japanese import version contains bonus track diamond head cover prince label elektracomments justice all last classic metallica album 80s also final attempt thrash metal once 90s rolled around producer bob rock entered picture band took more mainstream metal approach majority songs long complex riffs borderline progressive let first say years disc sat shelf thought overproduced didnt like ulrichs snare drum sounded cheap tinny or his double bass sounded shallow metallic partly due coin taped drum skin where foot pedal hit newsteds bass nonexistent standard explanation combines newsteds absence mixing sessions where could have voiced his opinion lingering issue his newness within band following death burton there three songs just could not get into eye beholder shortest straw lightning fast dyers eve articles read about 3 original band members hazing not accepting newcomer newsted infuriating call if fun call pranks call cruel newsted simply did not deserve

The English the Era the characters the countryside.... it got to the point where I couldnt wait for the evening to come so I could continue reading.This also seems to me to be an important cornerstone book for other great English literature. The theme (though just a seed) for  Scrooge in A Christmas Carol begins here in a story called The Goblin Who Stole a Sexton a story related during one of Pickwicks Christmastime visits to a friend in the country. When reading The Wind in the Willows or Tolkiens works I cannot escape the feeling that they were also influenced by the charm the sense of humor (okay humour) duty to friends and the simple but most important things in life which Dickens so impressively describes.The only negative thing is that I discovered that it had an effect on me which made me wish that I was free from the drudgery of daily work was retired (with ample monetary means of course like Pickwick himself) and could devote the remainder of my life to similar ramblings adventures and pursuits.An excellent book,3.0,3.0,Charles Dickens,just finished second reading iti really cannot add much great reviews already written ive always loved dickens way words book treasure department english era characters countryside got point where couldnt wait evening come so could continue readingthis also seems important cornerstone book other great english literature theme though just seed scrooge christmas carol begins here story called goblin who stole sexton story related during one pickwicks christmastime visits friend country when reading wind willows or tolkiens works cannot escape feeling also influenced charm sense humor okay humour duty friends simple most important things life which dickens so impressively describesthe only negative thing discovered had effect which made wish free drudgery daily work retired ample monetary means course like pickwick himself could devote remainder life similar ramblings adventures pursuitsan excellent book

McAllister MRD,Somewhere in the Field,I first read this extraordinary book in 1986 just two years after it was first published.  Picking it up again I find it eerily applicable to our current situation. There is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings this message back to the forefront.Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous. And yes I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britains stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war THE MARCH OF FOLLY invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.Given our current war policies efforts and mistakes in Iraq Tuchmans masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess regardless of individual political leanings that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable.

This is a problem that affects every country not just the U.S.A. since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the World. The interest of big advertisers is being protected by U.S. policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere. Even the smallest community in the South-Mexican jungles knows Ronald McDonald. CNN has Latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most Latin countries. As an outsider I hope the U.S. citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of Democrats vs. Republicans but a World-wide issue of the individual vs. the big corporations. In reality they dont care about your political affiliations as long as you saturate your credit cards to buy their heavily advertised products you can debate each other to death,16.0,20.0,Robert W.

This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernsteins efforts at uncovering the truth internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering and covert meetings with confidential sources.  They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the worlds best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.This book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was.  Instead of printing first and asking questions later Woodward and Bernstein along with their editors took painstaking efforts at checking double checking and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print.  It seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now ask questions later and file a retraction in small print even later.  This book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt Presidency.

1358,087975124X:excellent.:kevin_eric_clark,087975124X,Atheism: The Case Against God (Skeptics Bookshelf): Books: George H. Smith,books,5,Excellent.,June 28 2006,Kevin Eric Clark,,A lot of the reviews I have read here both positive and negative have noted Smiths acerbic and sometimes hostile tone. In my own discussions on god particularly when engaging Christians I probably would not use SOME of the more harsh language found in the book. It tends to be devisive and unproductive and also reinforcing many of the deragatory stereotypes that are applied to Atheists.That does not mean that any of Smiths arguments are not legitimate or powerful. They should be confronted by ANYONE who takes any position regarding religion or god.Perhaps the most revealing and important passage of the work comes at the beginning of the Chapter discussing the purported proofs for the existence of good posited by Christian Thealogians and laymen. Smith explains that Many times in the past before knowing better I would engage in arguments with theists who claimed to have a rational foundation for their belief. After several painstaking hours of pointing out flaws in the proposed arguments I would receive some form of the following comment: well it really doesnt matter if these proofs are invalid because I have faith in the exstence of god anyway. The Theist who resorts to this approach has no claim to rationality- only lack of integrity. Smiths frustration throughout the text at this type of intrangisence is palpable and ultimately entirely understandable.Some of the reviews on this page are illustrative of the general resentment which most Christians seemed to hold for the methods by which human beings acquire knowledge and distinguish truth from falsehood. As an outspoken Atheist I have heard these types of decrees repeated to me ad nauseum- and they never stop being disturbing. Lean not on your own understanding I have been told again and again. Trust in the lord and stop using all this silly logic or god wants us to believe like children they will say.All I hear is: I am happy being ignorant.

1359,1573226122:innocence_lost_or_boys_will_be_cruel:dennis_littrell,1573226122,Lord of the Flies: Books: William Golding,books,5,Innocence lost or boys will be cruel,November 2 2006,Dennis Littrell,SoCal,Golding is a deeply symbolic novelist who relies especially in this novel and in The Inheritors (1955) on ideas from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.  The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pigs head upon a stick stuck in the ground a totem in the making perhaps but seen by Golding as Beelzebub the lord of the flies the devil a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition the will to power and the primordial need to survive.  When Piggys glasses which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken it signals the degeneration the return to the wild in which as Thomas Hobbes has it there are No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary poor nasty brutish and short.That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful or more exactly as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.  Should we through nuclear warfare a runaway greenhouse effect sectarian violence on a global scale or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization regress to the state of savages we have this warning.Instead of the noble savage instead of a return to the Garden of Eden instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boys school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.  As in The Inheritors Golding sees not the good in humans but the viciousness.

Mayer: Books: Scott Eyman,books,4,Splendid but flawed biography,August 12 2005,careful reader SY,Washington Connecticut,Not only a terrific portrait of Louis B. Mayer but a wonderful history of Hollywood movie-making.  My caveat is the portrait of Dore Schary.  While Eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between Mayer and Thalberg Eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the Mayer Schary conflict in the last part of the book possibly to correct the view of Mayer the Monster and Schary the savior in earlier Mayer bios.  His portrait of Schary a man I knew bears no resemblance to that decent fair minded and gifted man.  It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary.  Eyman claims that Schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals yet Schary in his post MGM days produced a successful musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown.  Whatever good flims came from MGM during Scharys reign are dismissed as the work of others. He creates a portrait of Schary as a talentless hack forgetting not only the good films Schary wrote in earlier days but the successful Broadway play he wrote about FDR Sunrise at Campabello.  He writes that Schary only spoke of himself in retirement.  I knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends.  If he can get Schary so wrong it forces me to question his other judgments.  Having said all that I think this is a fine book evoking old Hollywood with grace and style.   ,2.0,3.0,Scott Eyman,not only terrific portrait louis b mayer wonderful history hollywood moviemaking caveat portrait dore schary while eyman fair his depiction struggle between mayer thalberg eyman found necessary choose sides mayer schary conflict last part book possibly correct view mayer monster schary savior earlier mayer bios his portrait schary man knew bears no resemblance decent fair minded gifted man clear interviewed few surviving friends family members schary eyman claims schary had no knowledge making musicals yet schary his post mgm days produced successful musical unsinkable molly brown whatever good flims came mgm during scharys reign dismissed work others creates portrait schary talentless hack forgetting not only good films schary wrote earlier days successful broadway play wrote about fdr sunrise campabello writes schary only spoke himself retirement knew few older men who took such interst world affairs fortunes misfortunes his friends if can get schary so wrong forces question his other judgments having said all think fine book evoking old hollywood grace style

Yau Voracious reader,San Francisco CA,NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses. The protagonists experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama comic relief political satire class comedy social criticism and domestic farce they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray to the minutest nuance an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics. The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens: a generic virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate. Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world to be separated from the people he loves and to be proscribed like a criminal. The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens outrage at the cruelty and social injustice.When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his fathers death he turns to his hard-hearted uncle to solicit succor. But Ralph Nickleby a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows. The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed. Its not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains. He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred. He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers Dotheboys Hall a school for unwanted boys as an assistant master.

Carter,books,5,Provides Great Insights Into Life,May 19 2006,Jerry Sanchez,New York,The reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded. The conversations in the book are intelligent the characters and dialogue are real and the descriptions and settings are vivid. While the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon Yale and New Haven it is sometimes hard to believe especially given that the author has been a faculty member at Yale Law School for over twenty-years. This is not to say however that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate. Rather they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university (Yale) and those that are not.In short I enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right. This is not a read-it-in-one-day thriller that Grisham might come up with. Instead this is a much more intellectual read. What I enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself. Carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life careers law and racism in this country. If you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters (especially Talcott) believe me this book will reward you and youll be glad you read it,2.0,3.0,Stephen L.

In 1983 when the original hardcover edition came out this book was given to me as a gift by  someone knowing my musical tastes figuring that it would be the perfect  gift. It turned out to be but for reasons that are largely  non-musical.As an arm-chair scientist Ive read and enjoyed more than a  few popularizations by well-known scientists over the years. These include  Richard Feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote (I  number myself among those physicists who cut their eye teeth on the  Feynman Lectures in Physics) Stephen Hawking Brian Greene Carl Sagan  and even Brian Swimme. (The Swimme of A Walk Through Time goes down  easily and covers much of the same ground that Thomas does but in a quite  different way; the Swimme of The Universe is a Green Dragon is a much  harder sell for me due to its hard-pressed attempt to oversimplify.) But  for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope and for essays that  provoke thought on the part of the reader none can hold a candle to  Thomas.Everyone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her  favorites. Here are a few of mine:In Things Unflattened by Science (an  essay on unaddressed and/or incomplete challenges that future scientists  might well undertake) a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to  better understand what music is and how it affects the human condition  starting with a rather small-scale assignment to explain the effect of  Bachs The Art of Fugue on the human mind.In Altruism (an essay on  the symbiotic interrelationships among species) how it is that such a  condition actually exists and a challenge to future,54.0,55.0,Lewis Thomas,onetime practicing physicist now just armchair physicist lifetime music lover have found beautifullywritten little book irresistible over 17 years been library 1983 when original hardcover edition came out book given gift someone knowing musical tastes figuring would perfect gift turned out reasons largely nonmusicalas armchair scientist ive read enjoyed more than few popularizations wellknown scientists over years include richard feynman his wry humor virtually everything wrote number myself among physicists who cut eye teeth feynman lectures physics stephen hawking brian greene carl sagan even brian swimme swimme walk through time goes down easily covers much same ground thomas does quite different way swimme universe green dragon much harder sell due hardpressed attempt oversimplify sheer elegance poetry breadth scope essays provoke thought part reader none can hold candle thomaseveryone who reads little masterpiece have his or her favorites here few minein things unflattened science essay unaddressed andor incomplete challenges future scientists might well undertake paragraph how biologists might endeavor better understand what music how affects human condition starting rather smallscale assignment explain effect bachs art fugue human mindin altruism essay symbiotic interrelationships among species how such condition actually exists challenge future

1382,0001047574:adventures_of_huckleberry_finn-_a_racial_controversy:rachael_sall_rachael,1047574,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Books: Mark TwainMike McShane,books,4,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn- A Racial Controversy,July 31 2006,Rachael Sall Rachael,Florida,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public multiple committees banned the book proclaiming it to be racist and trash. To this day Mark Twains Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts. In my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert OMeally. He clearly states that the intent of Twains word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur nigger can be seen as offensive but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character time and place at which the slur was used casually. Besides the usage of the word nigger characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality.  In the begining of Chapter 14 Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Hucks thoughts: Well he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger. Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.I strongly support Mark Twains the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it s dialogue plot originality and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America.,,,Mark TwainMike McShane,adventures huckleberry finn been argued racial controversy since first day published shortly after accessible public multiple committees banned book proclaiming racist trash day mark twains adventures huckleberry finn banned several school districts personal copy adventures huckleberry finn there helpful informative introduction notes throughout text written robert omeally clearly states intent twains word usage needed order properly vividly describe setting tone book his usage racial slur nigger can seen offensive believe necessary realistic dialogue huckleberry uses throughout book stays very true his character time place which slur used casually besides usage word nigger characters book often loudly express racist mentality begining chapter 14 huck jim talking about all sorts topics both them speaking mind twain describes hucks thoughts well right most always right had uncommon level head nigger obviously some would perceive intolerable crude yet believe twain simply describing way huck thinks jim growing friendship between huck jim basis entire novel book depicts way huck feels thinks about several ideas concepts about life way feels about his friend must present elaboratei strongly support mark twains adventures huckleberry finn book wins people over s dialogue plot originality capability express realistic story takes place racist unjust america

Grabbed my brain and would not turn it loose...because the pages SCREAMED... THIS IS YOU!. I am now 51 years old and have had the cross of ADHD ... or blessing... as you may see it all of my life. I found myself picking up the phone to call close relatives and grabbing friends to lecture them on what was going on...mostly reading straight from the book. My mother wondered if my father and older brother had ADHD. Dad is dead now but this can help me put some of the dysfunction in our relationship together.  Yes I have been persecuted for having untreated undiagnosed ADHD. Yes this book explained an awful lot to me gave me real solutions and encouraged me knowing that the two authors are also blessed / victims of this malady / mental enhancement! I subsequently have bought copies for my aged mother in another state and for my fiance. I have to say my fiance read it through and studied it like a how to manual for fixing me! (Shes a little scary sometimes!) And of course I sent a copy to my brother the doctor who has added it to his trusted library of resources and textbooks. I am now on one of the medications for the neurotransmitter stimulus. I have opted out of the antidepressants because of their scary side effect warnings. But the stimulant works to calm me and flush me with something I dont have without the medication. It makes a difference. I feel better and more confident more able to concentrate and more up to meeting all the challenges of life. What more can I say?

Writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of Photoshop DeWolfe begins by showing the photographer with many examples how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities.  The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light luminosity and color give life to an image and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.  DeWolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work.  After showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to fine-tune it DeWolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which once mastered allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis. The workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing Photoshop techniques and before/after image adjustments. Those who think visually will find these particularly helpful.DeWolfes approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results.  (Some Photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking; as a photographer who uses this tool I appreciate its simplicity and controlled results.)  His focus is not on tips-and-tricks in Photoshop but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest most straightforward way.  While a first reading gives valuable insights the books true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images and practices to become proficient.

The paper quality is a teensy bit better with this set as the paper is slightly thicker.The illustrations are very colorful and pretty it has drawings and he complements each with colors such as bright blue and fuchsia. The drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of high-heeled shoes or little kisses to a close-up of a very Warhol-esque face. At the top of each sheet there are little quotes of Andys relating to fashion. Very cool for maintaining the overall theme I think. The different colored-envelopes each have a flap that more or less complements one of the particular sheet designs but of course as the name suggests its all open to a little mix&match. Finally there are quite a lot of stickers to decorate your mail as your will dictates. Theyre very pretty too including purses mannequins kisses and oh theyre the clear kind so they look a little bit more distinguished.All in all a very good way to spruce up your everyday mail.

Lost World is a grabbing novel and will keep you reading for hours on end. Crichton gives great descriptions of characters places and objects that will keep guessing if he was really on the island. It makes you feel like you are a part of the story on the island or off. Crichton has made novels that continue this novel and start this novel. Jurassic park was Crichtons novel before this and Jurassic park III is the novel that continues this novel. Lost World is exciting adventurous grabbing and will always be a great novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes adventures and anyone who likes to feel like youre in the story.

But if youre one of those people who has a need to get every single question right this is not the book for you.  The book doesnt cover every single thing you need to know for the exam just enough to pass it.

Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar Baslim we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom though we see that in fact slaves sometimes have more freedom of choice than free men. The society he paints here is vivid and believable (though the economics of slavery in a star-travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me). Baslim is far more than he appears to be and puts Thorby through a rigorous education both academic and practical. How do you become a really good beggar? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do do it to the best of your ability from begging to juggling. Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums. These are items that may pass over young readers heads but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined nothing should be accepted on faith that personal integrity is more important than success that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action. Later Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture. Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom: a persons ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives. The Free Trader society (which owes much to Margaret Meads seminal ideas and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security peace of mind and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without ,3.0,3.0,Robert Heinlein,citizen explores just what freedom really follows young man thorby matures boy man starting slave sold most unusual beggar baslim see first aspect many equate absolute opposite freedom though see fact slaves sometimes have more freedom choice than free men society paints here vivid believable though economics slavery startravelling culture always seemed little dubious baslim far more than appears puts thorby through rigorous education both academic practical how do become really good beggar here heinlein falls ayn rand whatever do do best ability begging juggling also there several comments included here about integrity self lies others misleading yourself both come some dictums items may pass over young readers heads perhaps planting seeds all assumptions should examined nothing should accepted faith personal integrity more important than success consequences actions should examined carefully before committing action later baslim calls some favors sends thorby live free traders group space merchants keep themselves own unique culture here thorby discovers another aspect freedom persons ability do wishes severely constrained culture which lives free trader society which owes much margaret meads seminal ideas highlighted anthropologist character named margaret mader heinlein not usually so obvious his names rigid matriarchal domination separation into moieties provides security peace mind ability through rigid rules formalism allow small group people live together extended periods without

I feel like I would have had a much better understanding of this subject (not to mention appreciation of the people involved) had I discovered it a long time ago but I suppose late is better than never.Ted Conover did what I dont imagine very many other Americans would have the courage to do: Cross illegally from Mexico into the US with Mexicans doing the same thing. In doing so he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some Mexicans to make that journey (i.e what life is like where they come from) what the journey is like and what awaits them on this side of the border. I found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born American and simply in awe of the Mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north.Conover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of  ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved.

Munson,Dixon IL,Many people remember the battle of Midway as the turning point of the war in the Pacific due to the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers and rightly so.  But would the American success at Midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons?  Probably not.  In this eye-opening account of the battle author Alvin Kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes cleared the way for the SBD Dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the Japanese carriers.After sighting the enemy carriers the three American flattops began launching their torpedo bombers dive bombers and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the Japanese fleet.  However while en route to the target almost all of the squadrons became separated and the USS Hornets contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the Japanese fleet. Its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea.  Meanwhile the planes from USS Yorktown and USS Enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks.  Thus the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection.These planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from Japanese fighters.  Out of a compliment of 51 planes 44 were shot down.  One man Ensign George Gay survived from Torpedo squadron 8.  Not a single American torpedo hit the Japanese fleet.  However this sacrifice was not in vain for a few minutes later the SBDs found the Japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three Japanese carriers to the bottom.  The fourth followed later in the day.The author brings up some interesting points in the book.  For example he mentions the confusing flight plan of the Hornets commander Ring who for some reason chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the Japanese fleet.

The book has so many poems that struck a chord with us; just one small example: With recent cold weather I ended up sharing Dragon Smoke (about day being so cold you can see your own breath) with my oldest sons class at school. I have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise.  The pictures are perfect for the poems creating a completely wonderful package. It is just an absolutely superb book and one I will be buying as a present for many other families.

I read half of it then moved from Seattle to Valdez Alaska.  All the while I was moving I could not stop thinking about this book.  As soon as my shipment arrived I found the book ASAP and finished it.  I have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books.  I look at it this way:  Spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - PLUS - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.  This is a great idea especially for women that have children a job and the home to contend with.  Jim Karas was overweight for several years.  He can relate to me.  He revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because I simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back.

Miller,,Oh Spike in San Antonio. Its so hard to believe that sexism exists isnt it? Im not sure where your numbers come from as your logic seems tenuous at best but according to that left-wing liberal think tank known as the US Census Bureau Rowe-Finkbeiner is right. And its getting worse. The Census Bureau reported in August based on the Current Population Survey that womens  real median earnings fell by $171 or 0.6 percent from 2002 to 2003 while mens increased by  $336 or 0.8 percent. (The increase for men was not statistically significant but the decrease for women was.) The gender wage ratio thus fell to 75.5 compared with 76.6 in 2002. In addition a U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in October of 2003 controlling for changes in education and work experience over time concludes that womens earnings have  remained stagnant relative to mens for an even longer period--17 years--with a gap that cannot be explained by measurable differences in education and experience.If you actually read The F-Word you might find  cited cases like this: Although women make up nearly 3/4 of Wal-Marts workforce men hold 90% of management positions--despite female employees receiving better performance evaluations overall--and female employees are paid lower wages than male employees for the same jobs. None of this is disputed by the corporation. Why? According to Wal-Mart because men are there for a career while women are working for pocket money. I wish I could say your attitude was merely naive--but the truth is its far more dangerous and insidious. Thanks to Rowe-Finbeiner for telling it how it really is.    ,24.0,24.0,Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner,oh spike san antonio so hard believe sexism exists isnt im not sure where numbers come logic seems tenuous best according leftwing liberal think tank known us census bureau rowefinkbeiner right getting worse census bureau reported august based current population survey womens real median earnings fell 171 or 06 percent 2002 2003 while mens increased 336 or 08 percent increase men not statistically significant decrease women gender wage ratio thus fell 755 compared 766 2002 addition us government accountability office gao report released october 2003 controlling changes education work experience over time concludes womens earnings have remained stagnant relative mens even longer period17 yearswith gap cannot explained measurable differences education experienceif actually read fword might find cited cases like although women make up nearly 34 walmarts workforce men hold 90 management positionsdespite female employees receiving better performance evaluations overalland female employees paid lower wages than male employees same jobs none disputed corporation why according walmart because men there career while women working pocket money wish could say attitude merely naivebut truth far more dangerous insidious thanks rowefinbeiner telling how really

Van Steenkiste,Atlanta GA,Kenneth Pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of Iran from the rise of the Persian Empire to the reign of the Pahlavis (pp. 3-100).  Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners starting with the hated Russians and Brits in its domestic affairs (pp. 4 41).  Many Iranians have angry psychological scars believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons (pp. 26 71 89 99 125 128 155-56 161 173-74 242 297 389).  Pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled American-Iranian relations in the last 50+ years.  The U.S. started building its satanic reputation after the CIA played a key role in helping the Brits get rid of Irans popular Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 (pp. 57-67).  Mosaddeqs crime was the illegal nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious Brits (pp. 52-56).  The U.S. did not improve its reputation among most Iranians by supporting the dictatorial Shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of Iran until his overthrow in 1979 (pp. xxv 72-140).  Pollack convincingly demonstrates that the Truman Administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the Shah to democratize and liberalize Iran when they had the opportunity to do it (pp. 49 76-77 81 89-90 104 121-24 136-40).  The Shah who was ironically considered sold out to the West became less and less amenable to the omniscient U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s (pp. 39 50 84 94 99-100 107 120-27 158 173).   After the revolution of 1979 the U.S. mostly supported Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the Islamic Republic (pp. 206-16 259-65 273-76 386).

They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains.  The first section of the book is about them their customs and the awful fear and darkness they lived in.  Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin and longing for release.  The horror of their pain is graphic and not suitable to be read to younger children.  The second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale his conversion and his burden for those in darkness.  He is drawn as a determined man physically strong and fit with firm convictions.  The book goes on to tell of Stans coming to the Yali people.  How a strange story begins over his identity protecting his life.  How the first few Yali Christians were killed and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered.  How another missionary family died in a plane crash except for the nine-year-old son whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ.  The book reminded me Christs words in John 12:24 Verily verily I say unto you Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone: but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.  On earth Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness.  ,1.0,1.0,Don Richardson,lords earth term yali warriors use describe themselves live heluk valley irian jaya only knowledge them reach outside world dark rumors cannibals beyond mountains first section book about them customs awful fear darkness lived don richardson does great job portraying people bound chains sin longing release horror pain graphic not suitable read younger children second part book describes early life stan dale his conversion his burden darkness drawn determined man physically strong fit firm convictions book goes tell stans coming yali people how strange story begins over his identity protecting his life how first few yali christians killed later stan fellow missionary brutally murdered how another missionary family died plane crash except nineyearold son whose friendship yali paves way them turn christ book reminded christs words john 1224 verily verily say unto except corn wheat fall into ground die abideth alone if die bringeth forth much fruit earth stan dale never saw fruit his life death brought forth rejoice heaven yali there through his witness
1427,0192833987:war_and_peace:_both_inscrutable:martin_asiner,192833987,War and Peace (Oxford Worlds Classics): Books: Leo TolstoyHenry GiffordLouise MaudeAylmer Maude,books,5,War and Peace: Both Inscrutable,August 22 2006,Martin Asiner,jersey city nj United States,Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it I read it as a novel for entertainment. Years later I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading I was able to examine the Russian names characters events and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going which it certainly is but in it Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space with one atom colliding at random with another but when a sufficient number act in concert such as Napoleons invasion of Russia their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms then they are drawing closer to a universal one with nature.  This one Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God.

1428,0451527925:an_immense_poetic_achievement:voodoolord7,451527925,Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained (The Signet Classic Poetry Series): Books: John MiltonChristopher RicksSusanne Woods,books,5,An immense poetic achievement,August 3 2003,VoodooLord7,Oklahoma USA,Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer Virgil and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer as are other elements but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences often with the principle verb at the end being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but as with most classical literature once the reader gets the hang of it it goes quite smoothly. The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Miltons Paradise Lost -- for one thing it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. The Divine Comedy is certainly an undisputed masterpiece but where it was more or less a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dantes political enemies Miltons work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter:  why mankind fell how the gods themselves operate and think the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin the importance of love in human relationships the moral problems of Gods justice. It is true that Dantes work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained at least in seed come straight from The Bible. But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition to be sure but far from fundamentalist and even quite ,30.0,35.0,John MiltonChristopher RicksSusanne Woods,add reviewer list people who hold paradise lost up lofty title greatest epic poem english language not only one best any language writing unabashedly tradition unrhymed homeric epic verse mitlon working well within what earlier purveyed homer virgil dante brings his own distinctive touch flair work opening lines long poem clearly inspired homer other elements milton very unique poetic style long sentences often principle verb end being one mainstays language very grandiose quite complex takes while get used have pay very close attention during first book most classical literature once reader gets hang goes quite smoothly divine comedy dante more towring reputation than does miltons paradise lost one thing older among who find milton superior divine comedy certainly undisputed masterpiece where more or less satire thinlyveiled attack many dantes political enemies miltons work deals much more complex profound subject matter why mankind fell how gods themselves operate think nature attractiveness evil sin importance love human relationships moral problems gods justice true dantes work more original paradise lost paradise regained least seed come straight bible milton only uses stories springboard exploration latent moral ethical problems lurking beneath milton explores problems refreshingly fresh perspective strictly within christian tradition sure far fundamentalist even quite

1440,0140421998:dont_try_to_read_it_at_one_sitting:moose/squirrel,140421998,Leaves of Grass: The First (1855) Edition (Penguin Classics): Books: Walt WhitmanMalcolm Cowley,books,5,Dont Try to Read it at One Sitting,September 20 2006,moose/squirrel,USA,Whitman is not the worlds greatest poet - thats probably Shakespeare - but hes certainly been the most influential American poetic voice over the past century. He was the first poet to take all of American life as his subject. Ever the Romantic Whitman was also the first poet to bring Romanticism into line with everyday reality.His narcissism can be annoying but his panoramic descriptions of life and the imagination have a singularly cumulative power.  Some of his short poems (A Noiseless Patient Spider and To a Locomotive in Winter)are individually memorable. The longer poem When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed indirectly about the Lincoln assassination is brilliant. I think most of his Civil War poems are overpraised but Come Up from the Fields Father is a masterpiece of its kind.On the negative side Whitmans transcendental philosophy which he likes to indulge at length will strike many readers as very sappy.  His style lots of details piled up on top of one another grows monotonous and readers who criticize his lack of traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just be brushed off. My advice is to not to try to get through it all at once. The poems rarely become difficult they just tend to blur one into the other. Which may actually have been Whitmans intention.Overalltheres never been a book quite like Leaves of Grass in any edition and thats why it keeps selling as a true classic. In other words a very old book that people still buy and read and enjoy even when no teacher is telling them to. Reading it will get you as close as one book can to actually living in nineteenth-century America with all its follies inequities and promise,2.0,2.0,Walt WhitmanMalcolm Cowley,whitman not worlds greatest poet thats probably shakespeare hes certainly been most influential american poetic voice over past century first poet take all american life his subject ever romantic whitman also first poet bring romanticism into line everyday realityhis narcissism can annoying his panoramic descriptions life imagination have singularly cumulative power some his short poems noiseless patient spider locomotive winterare individually memorable longer poem when lilacs last dooryard bloomed indirectly about lincoln assassination brilliant think most his civil war poems overpraised come up fields father masterpiece kindon negative side whitmans transcendental philosophy which likes indulge length strike many readers very sappy his style lots details piled up top one another grows monotonous readers who criticize his lack traditional poetic craftsmanship cannot just brushed off advice not try get through all once poems rarely become difficult just tend blur one into other which may actually have been whitmans intentionoveralltheres never been book quite like leaves grass any edition thats why keeps selling true classic other words very old book people still buy read enjoy even when no teacher telling them reading get close one book can actually living nineteenthcentury america all follies inequities promise

The latter I find is necessary for everybody whos up to something bigger in PHP.The PHP examples in the book are - I have to admit - maybe sometimes rather scarce. One would like to see more applications of abstract problems more examples. But is that what a book is for to give examples? I dont think so. For me a book is mainly a source of great ideas from great programmers anything else is available on the web.After having bought Advanced PHP Programming I purchased other books the topics of which I would not have considered without reading Schlossnagles work.

It is a plain truth that can not be avoided and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier the adult must equally do so with death not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life for if one denys its existence and its inevitability the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth no matter how difficult it would be to hear could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Rosss classic study of the dying process she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say to let them vent and at their own pace go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation anger bargaining depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears their possible financial burdens,10.0,11.0,Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,most us area thanatology something quite new despite fact death such intimate companion can come any moment our lives whether degrees or instantaneously irrelevant our ethnic social economic backgrounds plain truth can not avoided no technological advancements can make go away would personally like consider death ultimate best friend who would never desert despite what feelings may child innocent ablity humanize doll or toy soldier adult must equally do so death not shy away totally uncommunicative what means total cessation physical life if one denys existence inevitability person could not only suffer added unnecessary physical heartache or she could also augment physical stress mental spiritual religious grief well submission acceptance truth no matter how difficult would hear could highest catharsis medicine could not come close healing elizabeth kublerrosss classic study dying process she interviews patients various age brackets who teach living what dying means them even though experience individualistic specific person process dying universality which connects us all hence how do take sting wound death dying remove sting communication simply being there let patient say what or she say let them vent own pace go through classic defined stages dying process denial isolation anger bargaining depression acceptance patients become our teachers learn fears possible financial burdens

Webber,books,5,Well Done Book yet...,January 14 2005,J. Ruehs,Glendale CA United States,I enjoyed Robert Webbers book and have enjoyed hearing him speak as well. At a recent speaking engagement he echoed my own concern over the fate of the church in America. So much commodification has happened in the church that one wonders if anyone knows what it truly means to be ecclesia? Although I agree with much of what he says and am part of a liturgical church (The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod which utilizes the church calendar and has had a strong emphasis on liturgy - - - the church body which Webber received his doctorate from) my question is are we truly called to change the church in order to meet the people where they are at?  I agree with his assessments yet I question the reasonings behind doing it. Do we begin to emphasize certain things to the demise of others just because the culture would be more prone to come to the church? Or does the church remain faithful to its calling despite the changing tides of culture? Our self-centered culture always asks the question What does this mean for me? and this has been a active question in the church for sometime. I believe the question that we should be asking is how does God give meaning to me or what do I mean to God? Our focus needs to be off of ourselves and onto the Lord of the cosmos,3.0,3.0,Robert E.

Of course this is not the case as Brown is merely one in a long line of such thriller writers.  Probably the biggest in the bunch was Robert Ludlum but not to be forgotten is Jon Land.  Not quite the big name that Ludlum or Brown Land is nonetheless the most pure fun with outlandish plots and tons of action.The Last Prophecy brings back Danielle Barnea an ex-Israeli cop and Ben Kamal a former Palestinian detective.  Despite the obvious conflicts caused by their different backgrounds the two are faithful lovers and as the novel begins both working as investigators for the U.N.  In this case the two are called to look into a mass murder in a Palestinian village.  At first it appears to be a massacre by Israeli troops but it soon enough appears to be something far more sinister a conspiracy tied to events uncovered at the World War II and some lost prophecies of Nostradamus.  The last of these prophecies provides the key to the conspiracy.Land uses his standard formula for his Barnea/Kamal novels:  the two split up for the majority of the book to separately unearth parts of the plot only to converge at the end to stop the bad guys.  Typically the people who provide the information are assassinated by the villains before they can reveal all.  This formula works well enough since Land executes it well (and really Brown and Ludlum use a similar formula themselves).I wont say this is perfect writing but its plenty good enough to merit a strong four stars.  My biggest problem with Land is that he is only writing books featuring Barnea and Kamal; I miss his older novels with Blaine McCracken which were even more delightfully outlandish with their James Bond-like world conquest plots.  But in the absence of McCracken this series still fits the bill for what ,2.0,2.0,Jon Land,hype over da vinci code related popularity can sometimes get feeling some people probably think grand conspiracy novel started dan brown course not case brown merely one long line such thriller writers probably biggest bunch robert ludlum not forgotten jon land not quite big name ludlum or brown land nonetheless most pure fun outlandish plots tons actionthe last prophecy brings back danielle barnea exisraeli cop ben kamal former palestinian detective despite obvious conflicts caused different backgrounds two faithful lovers novel begins both working investigators un case two called look into mass murder palestinian village first appears massacre israeli troops soon enough appears something far more sinister conspiracy tied events uncovered world war ii some lost prophecies nostradamus last prophecies provides key conspiracyland uses his standard formula his barneakamal novels two split up majority book separately unearth parts plot only converge end stop bad guys typically people who provide information assassinated villains before can reveal all formula works well enough since land executes well really brown ludlum use similar formula themselvesi wont say perfect writing plenty good enough merit strong four stars biggest problem land only writing books featuring barnea kamal miss his older novels blaine mccracken which even more delightfully outlandish james bondlike world conquest plots absence mccracken series still fits bill what

Morris,London,Note to reviewers - the title of the book was a play on Hillary claiming that there was a vast right wing conspiracy against her husband in the Monica scandal - she and others stridently argued that the attacks on her husband were due to a right wing conspiracy (right up until the stains on the little black dress ruined everything).This is an excellent non-polemical book that sets out the steps taken by the left to unseat Bush. I watched from Canada and monthly visits to the US (business) and the book accurately reflects what was going on (rightly or wrongly) at the time. It describes how a loose linkage of the media Hollywood pop stars MoveOn.org (Soros) academia Kerry spinmeisters and the intelligentsia on the left and right coasts self organized to bring down Bush and the GOP.It is a good read and ties together many of the disparate threads into a reasonably accurate picture. Perhaps the book can be faulted - hence only 4 stars - because there certainly was strident activity on the right too. Limbaugh Hannity and OReilly of course doing their thing although not with the power of the mainstream media and Hollywood behind them.For me the interesting theme he points out is the self organizing nature of the endeavour driven by an almost irrational loathing of Bush.  Recall many Hollywood gliterrati threatening to move to Canada if Bush was elected. Im editorializing here - but it does seem strange that some reviewers - notably one from the UK - use this site as a platform for gross anti-US anti-Bush remarks rather than taking the time to actually critique the book in question,17.0,24.0,Byron York,note reviewers title book play hillary claiming there vast right wing conspiracy against her husband monica scandal she others stridently argued attacks her husband due right wing conspiracy right up until stains little black dress ruined everythingthis excellent nonpolemical book sets out steps taken left unseat bush watched canada monthly visits us business book accurately reflects what going rightly or wrongly time describes how loose linkage media hollywood pop stars moveonorg soros academia kerry spinmeisters intelligentsia left right coasts self organized bring down bush gopit good read ties together many disparate threads into reasonably accurate picture perhaps book can faulted hence only 4 stars because there certainly strident activity right too limbaugh hannity oreilly course doing thing although not power mainstream media hollywood behind themfor interesting theme points out self organizing nature endeavour driven almost irrational loathing bush recall many hollywood gliterrati threatening move canada if bush elected im editorializing here does seem strange some reviewers notably one uk use site platform gross antius antibush remarks rather than taking time actually critique book question

I see the same names here I saw for Kate OBiernes book Tony Blankleys book Michelle Malkins books David Limbaughs books...you get the idea. And most of your reviews say almost the exact same thing too. Youd think SOME of you would aim for creativity especially when youre accusing Republicans of being mindless automatons.That said Yorks research is impeccable and anyone who paid attention to the last Presidential election knows EXACTLY how hard George Soros Hollywood et al. worked to push Kerry through from Cameron Diazs teary If you want rape to be legal dont vote lunacy on Oprah to the dollars moveon.org spent demonizing the Swiftboat vets.

Kushner,books,5,A Faithful View of Our Favorite Psalm,February 12 2004,JAD,Longwood FL United States, Rabbi Harold S. Kushner is one of the best known authors of our time having written the classic book When Bad Things Happen to Good People.  This his ninth book was one of the top ten best selling religious books of the past year.  As the title indicates it is a study of Psalm 23 certainly the most beloved of all of the Psalms.  Dr. Kushner writes with a pastors heart and a special eye toward the healing wisdom to be found in that portion of Gods Word.If you are looking for a book about putting your spiritual life into meaningful practice you might wish to read this book.  It is filled with inspiration and encouragement for an ongoing trusting relationship with God.  Kushner takes each phrase of the Psalm as his chapter headings and verse by verse provides insight and practical suggestions for how to make these truths come alive each day.Throughout the book Kushner utilizes his vast knowledge of the original Hebrew text to help the reader understand the nuances of the words such as soul and cup.  He explains the nuances of what the soul is and why the soul needs nourishing.  He states The world asks so much of us.  We give ourselves so totally to our work to the task of raising our family and running a home that we often forget to take time to nourish our souls... (page 61).The fact that God helps us feel safe in an unsafe world (page 50) is the Psalmists theme repeated and emphasized in every line.  Drawing from the world of science and literature art and great works of theology this deceptively small book is filled with encouragement and blessing.Occasionally Christians forgo reading Jewish authors forgetting that Judaism is the forerunner of our own faith in Jesus Christ.  That would be a mistake.  For here we have a work that is sacred to both of our traditions presented by an acclaimed author dedicated scholar and proven congregational leader.

RobbSusan Ericksen,books,3,(4+)The Narration of Susan Ericksen Makes This Story Come Alive,December 4 2005,Tucker Andersen,Wall Street,I have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work. However I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the .... IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D. Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke). I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBains 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of New York City an area very familiar to me. I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005). I read ORIGIN IN DEATH the next book in the series as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005). As with other series which I have enjoyed I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved. In my opinion the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author Roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer Robb. My recent three star review (11/29/2005) of NAKED IN DEATH the initial book in the series discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt so I will not go into detail again here.

This is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear. The reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as Renan Max Weber and Stalin (although the views of Marx and Engels themselves or Lord Acton and Friedrich Meinecke would have been welcome additions) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars (Gellner Anderson Connor A.

It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! For this reason alone I would give it 5 stars. Here in the first chapter the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer not the equipment. They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. If you read nothing else but the first chapter alone I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. Or if not the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. In fact even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital.The next chapters give details about camera operations how to creatively use camera controls and another great topic how to tackle different photographic subjects. Just what I needed! I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. Although Ill probably not dive into it this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography.Other good stuff inside:1. Projects at the end of most every chapter. I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture!2. Information on digital aspect of photography. Although I shoot film slr I know that one day Ill want a digital slr so the info on it is nice.3. All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs!

I was not disappointed because this book deals among others with one essential aspect of human existence: mans difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status. The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who although belong to the same family can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality. In this family we see characters who are able to adapt understand the world and compromise while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self-abandon. This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings. It is for this reason that &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil,5.0,5.0,Thomas Mann,after viewing german artistic miniseries television many years ago decided read german family story rival galsworthys forsythe saga not disappointed because book deals among others one essential aspect human existence mans difficulty adapting hardships changes social status story buddenbrooks story moral values among individuals who although belong same family can astonishingly different understanding life grasp reality family see characters who able adapt understand world compromise while same time exposed who limited own upbringing life limited flexibility eventual disillusion selfabandon fundamental book world literature attacks two antithetic facets human nature two views world constantly battle within all human beings reason quotbuddenbrooksquot fundamentally allegory about man his internal turmoil major challenges life carefully crafted story psychological insight makes reading book definitely worthwhil

None of the essays are ultra profound but theyre still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited.  This book reminds me of Feynmans Rainbow by Leonard Mlodinow which I also found to be very enjoyable and like Mlodinows book Lightmans book is a quick read.As other reviewers have noted the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography biography the relationship between math and physics the nature and experience of scientific inquiry and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life.As indicated in my title if you have at least a popular-level familiarity with modern physics and can also appreciate the humanities I predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable and perhaps also somewhat enlightening.

Gilbert frumiousb,Amsterdam the Netherlands,It may sound as though I am damning this book with faint praise but I believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener.Written in clear non-academic language Buruma and Margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the New York Review of Books. The point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired.I notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book. There is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve. You will find that most reviewers (myself included) had a list of things that we missed in their overview. These omissions felt serious to me but I notice that the lists have very little in common. It is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try.If you already have an adament point of view in this discussion then this book may well irritate you. Buruma and Margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible given their own cultural bias. If however you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience. Since reading it I lent the book to a good friend (sorry publishers!) and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised.

But I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Some of the criticisms point to the elements I liked best.  The routine cases how they were approached and the results were a revelation to someone who has no real idea of police work except what Ive seen on Cops (constant action and crisis!).  There was a new story on every page and I wound up reading until 1 a.m. on a work day because I just couldnt help reading one more page.  The descriptions of the surroundings the characters the sounds and smells of the settings conjured up a real sense of being there.  I was fascinated by the character faults and virtues of the people in the book as Atkinson tried to remain true to McCains philosophy that most people arent entirely good or bad.  As a resident of the area I finally understand the gang wars that were taking place when I was growing up (I remember the old Boston Record American newpaper with the crime scene photos splashed across the front).

Parting the raging waters (for a few weeks anyway) was the quintessential diplomat Hans Blix. As it reads he was too diplomatic unwilling to state his results confidently for fear that it might drive UN policy. It didn?t help that he had a few doubts of his own; that in spite of not finding any &quot;smoking guns&quot; in terms of banned weapons he still sensed that Iraq was playing a cat-and-mouse game. Either the regimes odd narcissism allowed it to believe that it did not have to comply with the UN or it was hiding something.

Iraq had disarmed at the end of the Gulf War in 1991 just as they?d claimed. The UN inspection program had worked -- without knowing it.So how did the war move forward under false pretenses?

1480,0786205059:a_valid_reason_for_betrayal?:susie_morris_book_junkie,786205059,True Betrayals (Thorndike Large Print Basic Series): Books: Nora Roberts,books,3,A Valid Reason for Betrayal?,April 5 2005,Susie Morris Book Junkie,Beaumont CA,I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms as weve seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996. Unlike the other two True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres. To me it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours.Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother Naomi Chadwick had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if shed come visit her she was an emotional wreck. It seems the real reason her mother wasnt a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover. Talk about shock value! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life. Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life. Sounds like a typical plot line right? Well sort of but if Nora Roberts is writing it you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way. Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder.Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelseys broken heart? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years?  Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again? I wont give away any of the plot youll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure theres a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting. Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother-daughter relationship.

I am also the author of several articles written on the topic of learning Spanish. And now for my review . . . I tend to judge a Spanish-English Dictionary by the following criteria:1. Does it provide 21st Century Spanish vocabulary words or only outdated Spanish vocabulary?2. Does it provide BOTH the words that are commonly used in Latin America AND Spain or only one or the other?Using yardstick number one this book did fairly well. I found words such as raton not only defined as mouse as in the rodent but also mouse as in computer mouse. And pantalla wasnt only defined as a screen but a a computer monitor as well. However it only used the original definition of bajar (to lower to descend or to go down). It lacked the 21st century definition which is to download.Using yardstick number two this dictionary did well. For the English word block I found the Latin American definition of cuadra but I also found the European definition of the word which is manzana. Several Spanish-English dictionaries that I have used in the past only define the Spanish word manzana as the English word apple and only define the English word block as the Spanish word cuadra.It is important that a dictionary provides both the  Latin American and European Spanish words. From my experience Latin Americans tend to use different vocabulary words from one country to another. But if you use the European Spanish word even though they may not use the word they will be familiar,1.0,1.0,Merriam-WebsterEileen M.

I had never heard of him before this being his first release in the United States but the synopsis on the inside of the dust jacket caught my attention so I decided to give the book a try.      Most books coming out now have author blurbs of recommendation I take with a grain of salt. Most of these authors are paid for their reviews or they are personnal friends making it difficult to determine the sincerity of the review.  Everything is promised to be a white knuckle thriller or my personal favorite a rollercoaster ride of excitement but the majority of the time the book does not live up to the hype. This is definately not the case with Ice Station. This book is Action with a capital A! How this book has not been optioned for film bewilders me because if it is done right it would be one of the best action films of the past twenty years. The book alone left me exhausted.    For a quick intro without giving anything away (because I hate spoilers) a crisis emerges at an isolated Antarctic research station.  A marine recon team is sent to investigate and all hell breaks loose.  This is not an exaggeration.  When the action begins in this book it does not let up. Every time I thought the book was going to have a down moment to give me the opportunity to eat or get some sleep I got cold cocked by a left hook.  The characters only pause in the book to reload.    Now there will be nay sayers out there who will criticize that the book lacks any real substance.  Maybe there could have been more characterization perhaps there is a fact or two off when utilizing military jargon or technology or maybe an event bends the laws of probability but all I can say is I dont care.

Morais author of A Time to Celebrate: A Celebration of a Girls First Menstrual Period,California,I always look to see if an author stands in their truth.  If they walk their talk.  Dr. Christiane Northrup does.  I have read all of her books Womens Bodies Womens Wisdom The Wisdom of Menopause and now Mother-Daughter Wisdom.  They all embody her path to well-being and her knowledge on the subject of womens health.   In her book Mother-Daughter Wisdom she shares her own life experiences from raising two daughters and her expertise as a medical doctor and relates them to health and wellness.  I find this book to be a great tool and guide to help mothers raise empowered daughters and a model for a healthy mother-daughter relationship.  I have three grown daugthers and would have loved to have had this book when they were growing up.  I found out through much trial and error how to raise empowered daughters.  Dr. Northrup is a pioneer in our time venturing into these unchartered waters of how mothers and daughters can have a balanced and loving relationship.  She addresses the many challenges in our society today facing girls and gives suggestions on how to deal with them in a positive way.  She talks about mothers caring and nurturing themselves in order to care for their daughter.  This book is also a  reference book as Dr. Northrup covers from birth to adulthood for the many stages in a mother and daughters life.

Languedoc,Lebanon CT USA,As the authors state in the preface of the book the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate.Most of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. If you havent written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment.Some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developers environment that minimally supports the functionality. As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. The authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors they are invaluable for debugging. I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while,5.0,5.0,Richard MitchellJim McKim,authors state preface book main focus text show reader how write high quality contracts not text intended convince readers veracity design contract if developer academic knowledge assertions then book extensive examples likely convert design contract advocatemost examples presented book written eiffel object oriented language fully supports preconditions postconditions invariants without need preprocessing if havent written code eiffel highly recommend download eiffelstudio deploy examples book although there tools offer assertion facilities none provide ease use seen eiffel language text covers preprocessor imparts assertions java extra steps unique keywords required incorporate activate assertions likely prevent wide scale use tool software development environmentsome aspects object oriented languages such design contract multiple inheritance often taught through language integrated developers environment minimally supports functionality such developers form poor opinion concept not tool keyword support contracts eiffel makes language perfect learning tool which impart more than academic understanding value assertions authors state ardently developers have choice between spending hours hunting down causes runtime errors or instead allocating time write thorough contracts sometimes eiffel developer can state assertion accurate since contracts also assign responsibility runtime errors invaluable debugging recall instance when encountered postcondition violation while

The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage the man who would become President of the United States.

I will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot. I felt that like some of heinleins books the book is plauged with  politics less science fiction the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space other than that its all politics. Same thing with Citizen of the galaxy a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinleins knowledge in law.

McAfee,Richmond VA USA,I am an inveterate map reader. Whenever I travel there is a map in my pocket. But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins I collected. With time the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.   Morkots superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change. One of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview followed  by a series of in-depth accounts each from the perspective of the  important &quot;players&quot; during a given historical period.  This  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions their politics and battles are succesively presented.  From the  Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years thousands of miles and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today. For the first time after years of puzzling  over strange Grecian place names and leaders I am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of Christ.  I wish this had been the first book I read in my study of  ancient history.

Goonan www.meaningful-life.us,Pleasanton CA,I like most of Jack Kornfields work and this book is no exception.  It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.  The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.  Also it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.  There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.  Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.  In one section he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied no.. but Ive become a connoisseur of my neurosis.  In another section Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.  I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.  While the book is good I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.  I think this carries a part of the communication that doesnt come across in his books.My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.  This is on the 10 paramitas (perfections) and I think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life.  If you like After the Ecstasy the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well,3.0,3.0,Jack Kornfield,like most jack kornfields work book no exception lot good stories very entertaining each them illuminates important spiritual truths focus book misconceptions about enlightenment samdhi experiences also contains some beautiful accounts samdhi experiences taken various religious traditions there lot practical wisdom book about finding meaning spiritual path life general jack kornfield dispels illusion ever finished product or our various personality quirks ever disappear completely one section quotes ram dass who once asked did get rid all personality problems replied no ive become connoisseur neurosis another section jack talks about vocation or purpose life found particularly well done personally meaningful while book good think may get more out audio cd because get hear tone his voice inflections think carries part communication doesnt come across his booksmy favorite taped work jack kornfield buddha nature 10 paramitas perfections think represents his most poignant expression his thinking life if like after ecstasy laundry may want consider purchasing well

What she misses are her science references:On page 142 Bishop recounts the removal of a stinger: ...he grabbed the whole sac which simply squeezed in more venom. This is not true. It is an oft-repeated piece of conventional wisdom but in 1996 entomologists at UC Riverside published an article in The Lancet (348:301-302) with the conclusion that rather than removal method speed is of the essence. Visscher and Vetter wrote of their conclusion: The method of removal is irrelevant but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly (or getting out a knife blade or credit card) are likely to increase the dose of venom received. The advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed and as quickly as possible. On page 276 Bishop writes about royal jelly ...worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs one of which on this special diet will grow into a queen.  This is patently incorrect. Royal jelly as all beekeepers know is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first 2-3 days of the broods development. After this time most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives. It is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge. This was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as I have enjoyed the book very much and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment.

Chomsky reminds us that the majority  of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their  information about political affairs; both domestic and foreign. One can  only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic. So take for  example the popular myth of the persistent Soviet vetoe at the UN during  the cold war. Why do people believe the USSR was constantly vetoeing any  and every Security Council Resolution? Simple! When they did it generated  front page condemnation. When the US or the UK exercised their right of  veteo: silence. As Chomsky notes during the years of 1970 and 1989 the  former Soviet Union veteod 8 resolutions. The US veteod some 56. This is  what Chomsky refers to as Thought Control. Unless the public examine the  factual record of the UN themselves they will never come by this  information (at least not in the mainstream press). So although Chomskys  title may appear somewhat paradoxical or oxymoronic a moments reflection  on such facts shows it to be in fact extremenly pragmatic and truthful.  The question is have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself  and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs?  The  crux of Chomskys argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what  violence is to a dictatorship. Chomsky points out that in fact propaganda  is contrary to popular postulations more important and vital to a  democratic society because people still have some rights. That is since  people can talk the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words  come out of the peoples mouths.,201.0,210.0,Noam Chomsky,all articles books chomsky have read necessary illusions thought control democratic societies without doubt most exhaustively researched footnoted most logically structured most convincing chomsky reminds us majority populace rely various media institutions information about political affairs both domestic foreign one can only hold opinion topic if one knows about topic so take example popular myth persistent soviet vetoe un during cold war why do people believe ussr constantly vetoeing any every security council resolution simple when did generated front page condemnation when us or uk exercised right veteo silence chomsky notes during years 1970 1989 former soviet union veteod 8 resolutions us veteod some 56 what chomsky refers thought control unless public examine factual record un themselves never come information least not mainstream press so although chomskys title may appear somewhat paradoxical or oxymoronic moments reflection such facts shows fact extremenly pragmatic truthful question have honesty sheer guts question yourself challenge information which contributed beliefs crux chomskys argument propaganda democracy what violence dictatorship chomsky points out fact propaganda contrary popular postulations more important vital democratic society because people still have some rights since people can talk powers must ensure only correct words come out peoples mouths

Marren jtm497,Glen Ridge NJ USA,East of Eden is a beautifully written sprawling three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California. The story begins far away in the East on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons Adam and Charles. Adam is an upright honest young man who naturally draws people to him while Charles has an angry violent spirit. Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam. Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son. Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp closely mirroring Steinbecks own experiences during the Depression. Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives. The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California. Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch but Cathy is a vicious evil character with no redeeming qualities and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re-emerge much later when her sons are grown. Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch broken-hearted over Cathys desertion and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever which become an impossible task. Repeating the pattern of their fathers life the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their fathers love with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit. But this time around Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was.Steinbecks prose is masterful and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley lush with the rains brutal with the drought capture exactly why men were drawn to the west.

1515,0143035592:indubitude:myles_byrne,143035592,Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire: Books: Michael HardtAntonio Negri,books,5,Indubitude,August 8 2004,Myles Byrne,Seattle USA Inc.,If you liked Empire youll love Multitude. The authors and reviewers alike speak of Multitude as a follow up to Empire but I think something very different is happening here. Hardt and Negri have pushed and pulled each other forward over a vast and forbidding territory and in Multitude they have attained a height/depth of perception well beyond Empire. If you are attempting to learn your radicalism or inform your progressivism through Hardt and Negri then you may see Multitude as continuing from and expanding Empire and you may also join the chorus bemoaning the perceived digressiveness and discursiveness of both books. But what we actually have here are two attempts at the same fateful book: where Empire was the best try we had at the time Multitude now succeeds. Where the digression in Empire circled around the feeling of our world-cultural hematopoiesis the discursion in Multitude captures it.Fukuyama attempted to deal with Multitude in the July 25th NYT Book Review and either utterly failed at or purposefully decided to avoid addressing the book qua philosophy. At this point in his apologizing for economists it is hard to imagine that Fukuyamas name has ever been mentioned in the same breath as Hegel or that he has ever actually read any of the German Idealists;- whereas with Hardt and Negri we almost have that level of man among us again. For Fukuyama history has indeed ended because he has stopped feeling it and can now only move around his darkened signifiers. For Hardt and Negri and for those who have read listened and felt their way into the great becoming that is world history we are indeed not at its end but at its very beginning. The chief problem with this book is that the English language as a field of common meaning is not up to handling this level of thought anymore.

Why its good?1) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional believable realistic characters and this book is no different. 2) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department hes supposed to have been a crime beat writer. 3) Logical plot. His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers but they cant be if they are crime fiction. Rather he takes you through the investigation step by step going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime. Cons: The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir (Im plagarizing this word from some other review). The thing is Bosch is not your spiffy yes sir toe the blue line cop. And so even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes well cest la vie apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers lives.Im not going to spoil the book if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro. All Im trying to get across is why this book is good. A must buy,2.0,3.0,Michael ConnellyPeter J.

That alone earns it four stars.However I was disappointed that the editors chose to write from a pro-charismatic bias that may alienate non-charismatics. Indeed some of the shorter entries seem more like blurbs for the ministers and movements they represent rather than academic encyclopaedic introductions. The problem is not with what information is included so much as what information is *not* included - for example absent from the entry on Oral Roberts is any mention of the dubious fundraising techniques and outrageous publicity stunts for which he is most (in)famous. Ian Bilbys entry details his leadership of Elim New Zealand but includes no mention of the sexual scandal that led to his removal as Elims NZ leader. All but the most staggering embarrassments in Pentecostalisms history seem glossed over as if not offending anyone was a major principle in deciding what to include.I would expect a scholarly work to reflect both the glory and the shame of this important subject.

This is Browns manifesto on the liberal lifestyle which was spawned in that era. Reader beware ... choices and actions have consequence ... and ponder very carefully before being Cosmopolitan long after the expiration date. Living it up does NOT mean reckless behavior. Values are personal but when one womans values cause her to act in ways that impose the boundaries onto another (ie - affairs with married men) it is as much an imposition as bible thumping over others heads. People are free to do what they want but if they go down a certain road they have no right to take unwilling others down the path with them. Although now dated and updated with Sex and the City - ask yourself if you really want to be wild your whole life. Retiring one lifestyle for something stable is a rather good thing when the time is right.

This book is full of both information and recipes.  This was one of my first Italian cookbooks and is still one of my favorites.  This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian-American type that we are accustomed to in the USA.  If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend.However if you are a beginner Italian cook this is not the book for you.  The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen.  The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes.One complaint and it is minor is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks.  The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs.Overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking,1.0,1.0,Pellegrino Artusi,review written perspective serious home cook been studying cooking 25 years concentrating italian cooking last 10 yearsthis book targeted anyone wants learn history italian cooking book full both information recipes one first italian cookbooks still one favorites book authentic italian cookbook not italianamerican type accustomed usa if want good comprehensive book authentic italian food one books would recommendhowever if beginner italian cook not book directions written someone familiar italian kitchen author assumes have basic knowledge italian kitchen typical recipesone complaint minor lack glossy photographs have become so accustomed cookbooks recipes book more than make up lack photographsoverall book highly recommended serious about italian cooking
1528,0872202305:the_temporary_death_of_a_priori:a._steinhebel,872202305,An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: Books: David HumeEric Steinberg,books,5,The temporary death of a priori,March 11 2003,A. Steinhebel,Tacoma WA United States,Before the Epiricist philosophers came along it was generally accepted that there were certain things that humans merely knew facts to be true. Basic philosophical concepts were reasoned to be true by a priori reasoning. Thus complex metaphysical ideas were formed by inductive logic working off what was assumed to be true. Then Hume came along and destroyed more than two thousand years of metaphysics. Hume showed that everything we know can be broken down in to two categories: Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Relations of Ideas are things that a true by defintion. 2+2 will always equal 4 because that is how it is defined. Try as we might we can never successfully imagine 2+2 equalling 5. So relations of facts do not really tell us anything about the natural world. They are definitions we use to describe what is happening. Matters of fact on the other hand are ideas we have that arise from our experience with the world such as The Sun will rise tomorrow morning. Unlike with Relations of Ideas Matters of Fact are not true my their defintition. We can imagine successfully The Sun will not rise tomorrow. How then if we can imagine the supposed impossible do we know anything to be truly impossible? Hume creates the basis for philosophical skepticism in this enquiry. He effectively show us that we can never know anything to be absolutely true. It wasnt until Kants Critique of Pure Reason that philosophy recovered from the blow of Humes metaphysics. This is a seminal text in the history of metaphysical and epistimilogical work and should be read by any and all philosophers,3.0,7.0,David HumeEric Steinberg,before epiricist philosophers came along generally accepted there certain things humans merely knew facts true basic philosophical concepts reasoned true priori reasoning thus complex metaphysical ideas formed inductive logic working off what assumed true then hume came along destroyed more than two thousand years metaphysics hume showed everything know can broken down two categories relations ideas matters fact relations ideas things true defintion 22 always equal 4 because how defined try might can never successfully imagine 22 equalling 5 so relations facts do not really tell us anything about natural world definitions use describe what happening matters fact other hand ideas have arise our experience world such sun rise tomorrow morning unlike relations ideas matters fact not true defintition can imagine successfully sun not rise tomorrow how then if can imagine supposed impossible do know anything truly impossible hume creates basis philosophical skepticism enquiry effectively show us can never know anything absolutely true wasnt until kants critique pure reason philosophy recovered blow humes metaphysics seminal text history metaphysical epistimilogical work should read any all philosophers

Altas Shrugged lays out in the form of a sprawling novel Rands philosophy Objectivism.  It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them trailing only the Bible.Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society; people who invent design build manufacture improve and manage.  She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyones standard of living while they improved their own.  Mysteriously societys producers start vanishing one at a time until almost none are left.  The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point.Our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from.  The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away.  Rand reminds us of this critical but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way.Read it and then tell ten friends to read it too.  More of us need to see this side of the story.

Your own political outlook will determine whether you think Horowitz is an American hero or a buffoon.  Ill vote for American hero as Horowitz provides details on professors whose very existence on a campus should motivate people concerned for their children and the destiny of the United States to march on the legislatures that use taxpayer funds to pay most of these academics demanding their immediate termination.  College has changed. Where the goal was once to teach young minds to think independently it is now a place for intdoctrination with punishment meted out for non-conformance to the various left-wing doctrines being rammed down the throats of young adults.  The book is so densely packed that choosing representative excerpts could easily create a shorter bookof its own. For example Professor Jose Angel Gutierrez opines [w]e have got to eliminate the gringo and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst we have got to kill him. This from a licensed attorney now a professor paid from the public purse - taxpayer dollars. Prof. Alison Jaggar another beneficiary of taxpayer money seeks to combat the male-dominant structure of everyday life. She seeks essentially a world without men. Not exactly an inclusive outlook.  The examples cited above are mild. Most are far worse - and these are the people often supported by taxpayers in public colleges who are forcing their views into the minds of young people. With tenure and increasing control of the hiring process other views are shut out of the academy. The academy itself is being converted into a political training ground.

No? Do you even know who Meissonier was?,June 13 2006,Simon Cleveland Author of The Basenji Revelation,USA,If not here is a chance to find out. Two figures left an imprint on the French art amidst the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century. Manet whom history dubbed the father of Impressionism (although at the time art critics branded him untalented) and Meissonier then the highest paid painters and now a figure obscured by history. How did time turn the tables on these two characters? Why is Meissonier forgotten while the Manets paintings sell with $20 million price tag? The answer is in this book. Mr. Kings skillful examination of the arts progression from its realism to the appearance of impressionism in the latter part of 1800s makes for a delightful reading. He analyzes the art critics of the time the leading political figures the consequences of a war with Prussia the French life and French economy. Written with intellectual appeal and with an eye on the events that drove history The Judgment of Paris is highly recommend to all lovers of historical non-fiction. -by Simon Cleveland,44.0,44.0,Ross King,if not here chance find out two figures left imprint french art amidst turbulent times late nineteenth century manet whom history dubbed father impressionism although time art critics branded him untalented meissonier then highest paid painters now figure obscured history how did time turn tables two characters why meissonier forgotten while manets paintings sell 20 million price tag answer book mr kings skillful examination arts progression realism appearance impressionism latter part 1800s makes delightful reading analyzes art critics time leading political figures consequences war prussia french life french economy written intellectual appeal eye events drove history judgment paris highly recommend all lovers historical nonfiction simon cleveland

Its hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe.I loved this book as a child (though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN which I think is a better book). However A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character Sara Crewe more likable. Saras determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. Some scenes (I dont want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical.  A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think. Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that (I think) is part of the books greatness. Be sure to get an unabridged edition: this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified. Kids now CAN read and will love this book: at least every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own.For a modern well-written book about another girl at an English boarding school read Libby Koponens BLOW OUT THE MOON. It has the same classic feel though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways (though she too is determined to hang onto her identity) and MOON is quite funny,,,Frances Hodgson BurnettTasha Tudor,book more dated than secret garden still great story hard not identify sara crewei loved book child though not much loved secret garden which think better book however little princess may appeal more some people some readers may find story stronger main character sara crewe more likable saras determination stay herself despite how other people treat her view her inspiring may help readers through tough times own some scenes dont want spoil surprise describing them magical little princess great story makes readers think some thoughts make uncomfortable like thoughts about differences between rich poor children think part books greatness sure get unabridged edition book beautifully written should not simplified kids now can read love book least every girl whom have given copy read reread her ownfor modern wellwritten book about another girl english boarding school read libby koponens blow out moon same classic feel though american heroine very different sara some ways though she too determined hang onto her identity moon quite funny

Nicholas,Montrose CA USA,Jesse Stone is sort of Spensers alter ego. Hes younger and Spensers never had a drinking problem but other than that theyre pretty much the same character except Stones about thirty years younger. Robert B. Parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now: this is the fourth Stone novel there are 31 Spenser novels three featuring his third character Sunny Randall and nine books that arent part of a series some of them non-fiction. Thats 47 books for those who arent keeping up with the math. Obviously by now Parker knows what hes doing. He seems able to write one of these every six months or so: he alternates between Randall Spenser and Stone with ease and just floats along.In this outing Stones faced with a real problem. Paradise (the town hes Chief of Police in) has been hit by a rash of killings and its soon apparent that theyre the work of a serial killer or killers. Stone has no way of tracking the killer at first and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish.Meanwhile theres also a scared girl at the local high school the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards. Stone has to resolve things and control the situation so that the girl doesnt get hurt.And of course theres his personal life which has been a problem for him since the series started with Night Passage. His ex-wife is a manipulative sociopath interested in only herself and how she can control him near as I can tell. In this installment she attempts to manipulate him more than she should and things take some interesting turns.I enjoyed this book a great deal and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading,,,Robert B.

I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation. I recommend it highly even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.I am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.These poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting.

J. Sutter,San Jose CA USA,Before reading this book Id had a much more black-and-white (sc. mostly black) impression of Jewish life in medieval and early modern Europe. This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). Katzs discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa among other topics are also quite fascinating. ,5.0,5.0,Jacob Katz,before reading book id had much more blackandwhite sc mostly black impression jewish life medieval early modern europe cogentlywrittten volume presents much more nuanced picture ghetto walls injustice also refuge many jews tense environment around them oddly enough circumstance contributed relatively large number conversions christianity liberal west after napoleonic liberations contrast shtetl jews poland russia who lived sidebyside gentile neighbors katzs discussions jewish martyrs during first crusade flexibility rabbinic responsa among other topics also quite fascinating

Wells,books,5,Why its still in print a hundred years later...,August 21 2006,Mark Wakely,Lombard Illinois,H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds as a warning to the complacent world-dominating British citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted. The arrogance of some British politicians in particular rubbed Wells entirely the wrong way particularly their sentiment that the British had an obligation to civilize the world (read: colonize) for its own good. Wells book was a rock thrown at that attitude-on-a-pedestal and although he didnt knock it down he made his point- and in spectacular fashion. In one way the Martians *were* the conquering British with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of Africa and other areas colonized by force.  Wells dark tale was also a warning that even the British- despite their firm belief in their world destiny- could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that didnt give one whit about the British (or anyone elses) false boast of superiority. In the end though its a hopeful book- just as the Martians died off because they werent biologically suited to live in this world Wells also foretells the end of the British Empire because the British (alien) way was not the native way of life in the colonies suggesting that the British wouldnt survive there long; the natives would eventually prevail. And they did. On top of all that its rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense.And thats why its still in print a hundred years later.-Mark Wakely author of An Audience for Einstei,3.0,3.0,H.

I mean come on... Dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world. Now were supposed to believe that he simply says damn she fell - I guess after all Ive been through I wont bother to check - Ill just find another victim - sorry didnt buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning..Overall the book was really great.

It was a good storyline I enjoyed getting a simple  glimpse into the media world.  It also gives you a good peek into the  corruption behind campaigns and politics in general. I really liked the  characters in this book although each one in my opinion could have used  some more depth.   The only reason this book doesnt get 5 stars is because  as you read it - you start to feel that the second half of the book  &lt;with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book&gt; was completely  RUSHED.  I really dont like a sudden closing to a book. However it really  does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages.  I just feel that it  could have had MORE of an impact and MORE of that &quot;UMPH&quot; had the  story been written at the same speed throughout. I do recommend this book  for anyone who just wants a good book to read.  If youre looking for  something you will remember for life - this isnt going to be it.

1558,0394727673:the_profit_order_world:andrew_coyle,394727673,Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison: Books: Michel Foucault,books,5,The Profit Order World,February 17 2005,Andrew Coyle,,Reviewers are right about this book tracing the origins of the modern surveillance state back to the birth of the modern prison system but they are not mentioning the prime motive for this that Foucault points to: profit and capitalism.  With the rise of industrial society it was more important to regiment and discipline the masses than off with their head or hands.  The panopticon prison idea was taken to the factory and service industry by industial giants like Carnegie and Rockefeller and the fruits of this profitable perversion can be seen all over society today: delivery drivers monitored throughout the day by GPS social security cards public schooling (founded by the same industrial giants) intellectual and psychological grading job placement and conformity credit ratings licences needed to do everything but go to the bathroom a growing snitch culture...Foucaults major thesis is that surveillance (discipline) aids profit and any deviation from profit leads to state-sanctioned punishment in the form of increased surveillance.  As industry and profits increase so will the surveillance and discipline that make it run smoothly.  Every facet of modern society works to this end.  The irony is as techno-pundits like McCluhan later pointed out in the modern world the prisoner with a tv set has as much denatured freedom as the tycoon in his guarded estate and they enjoy a lot of the same things in a world where pleasure is increasingly programmed and vicarious; in a world that has turned from the moral order to the profit order where bad credit today is the profit order version of the ancient moral order idea of excommunication.  Everything that stands in the way of the profit order whether it be an idea person religion or country is attacked.  Bottom line we are all human resources in the political economy in the religion of capital: packaged and packed like a bunch of sardines with the capitalist state and its laws protecting ,25.0,31.0,Michel Foucault,reviewers right about book tracing origins modern surveillance state back birth modern prison system not mentioning prime motive foucault points profit capitalism rise industrial society more important regiment discipline masses than off head or hands panopticon prison idea taken factory service industry industial giants like carnegie rockefeller fruits profitable perversion can seen all over society today delivery drivers monitored throughout day gps social security cards public schooling founded same industrial giants intellectual psychological grading job placement conformity credit ratings licences needed do everything go bathroom growing snitch culturefoucaults major thesis surveillance discipline aids profit any deviation profit leads statesanctioned punishment form increased surveillance industry profits increase so surveillance discipline make run smoothly every facet modern society works end irony technopundits like mccluhan later pointed out modern world prisoner tv set much denatured freedom tycoon his guarded estate enjoy lot same things world where pleasure increasingly programmed vicarious world turned moral order profit order where bad credit today profit order version ancient moral order idea excommunication everything stands way profit order whether idea person religion or country attacked bottom line all human resources political economy religion capital packaged packed like bunch sardines capitalist state laws protecting

1560,0156701537:totalitarianism:__nazism_and_communism.:prometheus_zosimos,156701537,The Origins of Totalitarianism: Books: Hannah Arendt,books,5,Totalitarianism:  Nazism and Communism.,October 9 2002,Prometheus zosimos,EVROPA.,Hannah Arendts _The Origins of Totalitarianism_ is a book that takes a hard look at two rival totalitarian movements in the twentieth century Soviet Communism and Nazism and traces their historical roots.  The book is divided into three volumes focusing on Antisemitism Imperialism and Totalitarianism.  The first of these volumes is concerned with the historical origins of Antisemitism.  Arendt examines some of the ways historians have dealt with the historical roots of Antisemitism.  For example some historians have argued based on a scapegoat theory that the Jews were used as an innocent scapegoat for the worlds ills.  Arendt concludes that such approaches are flawed because they fail to take into account the full historical situation of the Jews.  Arendt explores the rise of Antisemitism in the birth of the nation-state the emancipation of the Jews the rise of the Jewish financiers the roles of Jews within society and the infamous Dreyfus affair.  Of particular interest here is the role of conpiracy theories concerning such individuals as Benjamin Disraeli or the infamous forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The idea that the Jews constitute a race or are members of secret societies or clubs played an important role in the historical development of Antisemitism.  The second of the volumes in this book is concerned with the rise of Imperialism.  Here a discussion of racism and racial thinking is examined involving such racial theorists as Count Arthur de Gobineau and various forms of Social Darwinism.  The role of the Boers in South Africa is looked at and a thorough examination of the lives of such individuals as Cecil Rhodes who called for the creation of a secret society of aristocratic Nordic elite is made.

I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e. the media).  That being said I was not the least disappointed.  In his typical style Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English.  I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating.  He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of ER)!The book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;)  The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her.  There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.In summary I would not say that this is Crichtons best work but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone,2.0,2.0,Michael CrichtonFrances Cassidy,found airframe great book read summer vacation expecting more science fiction novel really book about corporate intrigue social commentary ie media being said not least disappointed his typical style crichton takes aerospace engineering course boils down plain english learned so much about construction airplanes airline industry fascinating also does great job raking mass media over coals which fun somewhat ironic creator erthe book fast paced reads like movie which am sure no coincidence crichton main character very likeable find yourself rooting her there number plot twists surprises certainly keeps turning pagesin summary would not say crichtons best work surely very enjoyable book would recommend everyone

Schelling,books,4,NOBLE PRIZE WINNER ON CONFLICT,October 10 2005,Laurence Stybel Boardoptions.com,Boston MA  USA, The 2005 Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to Robert Aumann and Thomas C. Schelling.  Schelling is professor of Economics at the University of Maryland and applied game theory to conflict.  His focus was on the weapons issues but his ideas have been applied to a host of business issues.	In this review we will apply some of Shellings concepts to how companies fire employees.	Schelling says uncertain retaliation is more efficient than certain retaliation when bargaining and the capability to retaliate is more useful than the ability to defend.  Now lets get practical.			GOODBYE SCENARIO	As a verb goodbye is the act of parting.  It is also an acknowledgement of parting.  A goodbye scenario assumes that once employees physically leave the building they will never be a factor for the companys future.  The relationship was transactional and the transaction is now over.  	If the firm defines the termination as a goodbye scenario the firm should be guided by a business model that says Whats the least expensive way of terminating this relationship?  And Board members should ask tough questions about paying too much.			AUWIEDERSEHEN SCENARIO	Auwiedersehen is German for Until we meet again.  It has a more open-ended quality than the English goodbye.  In an auwiedersehen scenario the assumption is that once employees physically leave the building they may continue to be a factor in the firms future.  But it is unclear what that factor may be.After their non-compete contracts are over they may join a smaller competitor and become potential allies or opponents in your firms efforts to develop strategic alliances or acquire the firm.  They may join firms that touch your industry and become potential referral sources of new business for you or a potential source of caution to others about using your company.They may attend alumni programs at their schools and encourage/discourage,27.0,52.0,Thomas C.

Plums biggest worries tend to be about whether she is lusting after Joe Morelli or Ranger how to get the latest bond jumper down to the police station and how she is going to replace whatever vehicle just got destroyed.  Definitely light fare even if her current problem is how to avoid death identifying the thief in a grocery store heist and then turning the local gang leader into a careening pinball in traffic. He not only wants Stephanie dead but he also wants her end to be spectacular.Stephanies response is to break up with her steady boyfriend Joe Morelli again gorge on jelly donuts and go into hiding at one of Rangers lairs.  Of course this doesnt work as well as it should because even Rangers soap is too sexy for words.  And Stephanie glutton for punishment that she is she has to go out and make sure everyone knows that she is trying to keep a low profile.  So you see this is standard Stephanie Plum fare - lighthearted mayhem and a heroine who is half macho and half wuss usually with bad timing.My issue with Evanovichs books isnt with any particular one but with what happens if you read too many at one time.  Stephanies biggest problem is herself - a decided lack of common sense.  Which is what you would expect from someone who works as a bounty hunter but leaves her gun in the cookie jar.  In four hundred pages this is funny but if youve been reading a lot in a row the steady diet of vaudeville sight gags is d�j� vu all over again.  After a break of a year or so this goes away and I found Ten Big Ones a pleasure to read.  It introduces a whole ne order of plot complication and one of the more remarkable bus drivers in literary history.

All right I say. So Im writing about a preteen book about a little girl. That doesnt make me weird does it? It shouldnt since I had to read it for a college course. So Im writing because well who wouldve ever guessed but I loved it? Its a ripping story man. It is funny inventive historic and riveting all the things I was sure it wouldnt be when I got assigned the book. So here I am blown away by a book about a little girl. I dont even like history but it wasnt presented as antiquated. It was dealt with as you and I would deal with our history as pertinent in the moment and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book. Im telling you the character Darby is great as are all the characters including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon etc until Darby unintentionally questions everything causing all matter of problems like maybe shell get knocked off by the Klan.

I am delighted to report that Undoing Perpetual Stress is an even better book.What is perpetual stress like?  The metaphor that Dr. OConnor uses is that of an impala who thinks theres a cheetah behind every rock.  The flight or fight response is never at rest . . . and the poor impalas health is soon destroyed.Dr. OConnor argues that our over stimulating world creates the same kinds of stress from unseen threats as the world goes whizzing by at 75 miles per hour.In the book he describes the sources of the stress how stress undermines your body immune system brain and mind and what you can do to put the stress comfortably in the background.  This book will appeal to those who are stressed out those who experience anxiety and depression at the same time those who love such people and those who want to better understand the mind-body connection based on the latest scientific research.Undoing Perpetual Stress is filled with many helpful exercises that will help even those who dont think they have too much stress.  One of the best from my perspective was taking a psychological snapshot of yourself every five years . . . and spotting what was wrong with your life at each stage.  I was astonished to realize how many memories I had repressed but which are still influencing my psychology.  And Dr. OConnor is good about reminding you to practice practice practice the exercises and his advice.I have been a meditator for over ten years and this book helped me to,32.0,33.0,Richard OConnor,decided read book because enjoyed dr oconnors book undoing depression so much am delighted report undoing perpetual stress even better bookwhat perpetual stress like metaphor dr oconnor uses impala who thinks theres cheetah behind every rock flight or fight response never rest poor impalas health soon destroyeddr oconnor argues our over stimulating world creates same kinds stress unseen threats world goes whizzing 75 miles per hourin book describes sources stress how stress undermines body immune system brain mind what can do put stress comfortably background book appeal who stressed out who experience anxiety depression same time who love such people who want better understand mindbody connection based latest scientific researchundoing perpetual stress filled many helpful exercises help even who dont think have too much stress one best perspective taking psychological snapshot yourself every five years spotting what wrong life each stage astonished realize how many memories had repressed which still influencing psychology dr oconnor good about reminding practice practice practice exercises his advicei have been meditator over ten years book helped

This is a perfect metaphor for the book When All Youve Ever Wanted Isnt Enough.  The book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside that always seems to want something more.  Until they arrive at that something more people can never truly feel content.As is the case with most of Kushners writing he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation. In this case he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes.  This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life.  In the end the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance.  Kushners overall point is best summarized on page 189.  Does it make a difference if I am honest good or faithful?  It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune.  ... It matters if we are true to ourselves to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them.  It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others making them and their world different rather than try and hoard life to ourselves.  It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day food and work and love and friendship as encounters with the divine encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too.  It is a simple yet beautiful message.

What we find with W.J. Cashs The Mind of the South is no different although it is a pleasant journey. Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing Cashs work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the Souths population in its description (blacks and women). What the modern reader is left with then is not so much a description of the the southern mind as it is the white southern male mind. And while Cashs work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South with a small dash of glory added for good measure. First it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown. Wyatt-Brown shows that Cashs battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South as was his upbringing. Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect:    The origins of Cashs interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change but in the very makeup of his mind. Like so many creative depressives he stood apart from the society around him. Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii). Wyatt-Brown with this statement makes Cash an outside-Insider by virtue of his being a manic depressive. He is a southerner and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however according to Wyatt-Brown by reason of his mental,6.0,6.0,W.

I enjoyed Radishs writing style purple prose and all. If youre expecting a Dickensian journey into a complex character this book is not it. However it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life. Yes the (positive and negative) circumstances of Megs life were unrealistic but I felt they were dramatized to make a point. We all have strong kind and amazing people in our lives but we have to look for these things in people. I had an aunt just like Marcia who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor courage and love for everyone around her.

Finkelstein,books,5,Insightful and Exceedingly Rare Scholarship,February 28 2006,James Bunnelle,Rome GA United States,Kudos to Finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter.  The fact that he himself a descendent of Holocaust survivors has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points: you cannot criticize the state of Israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-Semite.  Any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless UN resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism.  By far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the Swiss banks; this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition.  Finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion.  Very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work.

I have not seen the original so I cant tell how much of this book is new material (beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jacksons films).  Lobdell has examined Tolkiens writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives.  One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard etc.) on Tolkien.  Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age.  There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkiens own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings The Return of the Shadow.  I enjoyed this story though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to Tolkien. (But then no one can!)I am a long time Tolkien reader and addict (since the age of 12 in 1969.)

S. Joshi,Kettering,This is an excellent book examining how and why some people come to believe that they have suffered appalling abuse that most probably never happened. It DOES NOT deny the reality of or harm caused by sexual abuse (the author explicitly states this on many occasions) and the reviewer who suggested that this is a terrific book if you are child molester probably (I guess) didnt bother reading it and made up the especially foul accusation to prevent others from examining the issues surrounding repressed memory and the cult of therapy. The author shows how even trained professionals can disregard overwhelming evidence against a particular hypothesis (repressed memory/MPD/satanic cults) and rely on their intuition to (unintentionally) wreak havoc with their clients lives.

USA,Phyllis Chesler is a most unusual feminist. She really doesnt fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority gender feminist crowd. The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth. This seems to be her most pervasive (and endearing) feature as an intellectual and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent Death of Feminism release. Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be. Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text. On the whole it makes for compelling reading. We find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else. They have many of the same yet subtlety different characteristics as do men. In these pages Chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter-woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner. Many mother-daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations. Why feminists wouldnt have wanted this published seems rather silly to me. We should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy. Chesler never implies any inter-sex superiority or inferiority she is content to describe what is and its great stuff indeed.,1.0,1.0,Phyllis CheslerPhyllis Chessler,phyllis chesler most unusual feminist she really doesnt fit equity feminist crowd complete dissenter female superiority gender feminist crowd one thing makes her consistently worth reading her passion telling truth seems her most pervasive endearing feature intellectual trait ubiquitously display throughout her recent death feminism release here she tackles verboten subject which whether or not women unbridled source goodness many feminists assume them numerous examples misapplied unprovoked indirect aggression identified elucidated text whole makes compelling reading find women regular human beings just like everyone else have many same yet subtlety different characteristics do men pages chesler illustrates magnitude interwoman hostility strong social skills can often applied negative manner many motherdaughter conflicts projected into adult situations why feminists wouldnt have wanted published seems rather silly should regard women not objects fantasy chesler never implies any intersex superiority or inferiority she content describe what great stuff indeed

No Just Great Literature,September 6 2006,George R Dekle Bob Dekle,Lake City FL United States,Raskolnikov an impovershed student in 19th Century St. Petersburg conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker. He justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse. The world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education. Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. After all the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society. The crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with Raskolnikovs angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering. Almost every major character in the book is more likeable that Raskolnikov.The philosophy of Dostoyevskys book seems to be primarily a refutation of Hegelian and proto-Nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of Christian values. Along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-Darwinism.  Having known prosecuted and defended hundreds of murderers I was much taken by Raskolnikovs psychological progression from crime to atonement. Much of his self justification rang true to my experience. I have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth. So long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized the killer can live with the deed. When the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human guilt sets in and many confess--often years later. Raskolnikovs behavioural symptoms did not however ring true to my experience. Although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction they can usually control themselves much better than Raskolnikov. His actions practically shouted his guilt.

1610,0195182596:western_liberalism_on_trial:yibing_wu,195182596,Faith in Nation: Exclusionary Origins of Nationalism: Books: Anthony W. Marx,books,5,Western Liberalism on Trial,May 17 2006,Yibing Wu,WA USA,In Faith in Nation Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the literary trope (p 15) about a liberal inclusive Western nationalism. Instead he argues that even the truest brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale. His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today. This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position? Has he made the case for it? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong? I will argue that the definition of the state or the lack thereof is key to answering all of the above questions. Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence. However the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marxs entire theory on shaky ground.  According to Marx the state is the raison dtat of nationalism: for nationalism to become a historical force it must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement (p 8). Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is (p 4) he never spells out his definition of a state. In fact what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe. Only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts. Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism. Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism. Otherwise the St. Barthelme Day massacre,,,Anthony W.

Schivelbuschs small piece is a pretty good (but light-weight) example of  this genre. He reveals some interesting trivia along the way: he tells for  example how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of  first-class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed; he  shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting  social values of Europe and America. But he is at his most interesting when  describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of  geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations.  Furthermore by creating the need for standardized time-tables railways  nurtured a standardized/homogenized conception of time. Local  idiocyncracies became less important. Doubtless true national identities  could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and  communications.

Wilson Randy Wilson,San Francisco,First off this is A History of Hollywood not THE History of Hollywood.  David Thomson isnt writing the chronological straight-up blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies.  The Whole Equation is an essay that takes as its question are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?  He says they are both more and less than that.  More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen.  That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isnt often.  Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits.And unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension.  His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film you have to understand that its always about the money and about the art.  That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). To tell you the truth I dont think the book succeeds that well on that level.  He  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesnt developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight.For me that just didnt matter.  What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film.  He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic.  He uses the film Chinatown as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie I was in heaven.  He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater the audience the actors the costumes the music all of it.  He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.,4.0,4.0,David Thomson,first off history hollywood not history hollywood david thomson isnt writing chronological straightup blowbyblow account hollywood movies whole equation essay takes question hollywood films ever art like beethoven symphony or picasso painting says both more less than more because american film captures tension between wanting make money wanting say something which allows unintentional happen serendipity wonderful when works which isnt often less because there always artistic compromises someone always looking budget thinking about profitsand unlike most film critics just fine tension his argument understand appreciate american film have understand always about money about art means never truly art any pure way any art truly pure tell truth dont think book succeeds well level points out various people struggles dilemma through out history american film doesnt developed coherent argument builds his initial insightfor just didnt matter what makes terrific read david thomson knows loves film writes adolescent thrill openness about his subject makes fun poetic uses film chinatown his framing device alltime favorite movie heaven not deep thinker his book crackles his delight sensations whether movie theater audience actors costumes music all constantly raises questions throws out insights just tumble onto each other until realize like watching film must just suspend disbelief enjoy ride

One of Yegenoglus incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the Western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process.  As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation.  As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest but simultaneously displaced (62).  Her argumentation is lucid and compelling: for the colonial gaze the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire (in the fantasy of unveiling) as well as the bte-noire because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project.  The veil therefore frustrates the identity-forming process of the subject-object positioning in colonialist discourse; the subject cannot quite see the object and its subjectivity thus remains in question.  Interestingly this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by Western feminism.  As the veil has come to signify the backwardness of Islam and its inherent oppression of women the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference.  In this dynamic the identity of the liberated Western woman is constructed vis--vis the oppressed Muslim woman (102).  Since the status of Western women is contingent on the continued representation of Muslim women as oppressed Yegenoglu reveals that the Western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of ,3.0,4.0,Meyda Yegenoglu,colonial fantasies powerfully argued engaging dissection colonial psychology critiques orientalism isolate gender culture western feminist adoption rescue paradigm one yegenoglus incisive arguments desire nexus process colonial discourse constitutes western subject well possible resistance or interruption process desire frames relation between subject other yegenoglu argues veil interrupts relation barrier which other can see avoid being seen veil site which colonialist desire made manifest simultaneously displaced 62 her argumentation lucid compelling colonial gaze veil both tantalizing object desire fantasy unveiling well btenoire because precludes climax voyeuristic project veil therefore frustrates identityforming process subjectobject positioning colonialist discourse subject cannot quite see object subjectivity thus remains question interestingly overtly phallocentric logic identity forming through scopic penetration been inherited western feminism veil come signify backwardness islam inherent oppression women visibility veil itself comes embody difference dynamic identity liberated western woman constructed visvis oppressed muslim woman 102 since status western women contingent continued representation muslim women oppressed yegenoglu reveals western feminist establishment vested interest exceedingly patriarchal ideology

It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty.  However some sympathy is found for the victims of crime.  The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime.

As political thrillers go this is one of the best of the genre. Its packed with insider information from power-mad politicians and the amoral king-makers who advise them to nerves-of-steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the FBI.

This volume picks up a short time after the end of Drawing of the Three and we see Roland training Eddie and Susannah to become true gunslingers in Rolands world.  Soon into the novel the three gunslingers encounter one the Guardians of Mid-World a huge cyborg bear who is guarding a portal that goes between the different worlds.  Roland explains that each of these portals is connected to the Dark Tower by a beam and if they follow the beam it will lead them directly to the Dark Tower they just dont know how far away it is.As the three gunslingers start to follow the beam we the readers are taken to our own world and reintroduced to Jake the ill-fated child from The Gunslinger.  Jake is currently having a mental breakdown (as is Roland) due to the fact that Roland saved him from dying his destined death at the hands of a Cadillac in The Drawing of the Three.  One part of Jake tells him he should be dead the other says he should be alive.  Jakes mental breakdown leads him on a journey across New York to a haunted house that has many connections with other characters in the book and in this house Jake believes he can get back to Mid-World and be reunited with Roland.The final part of the journey in The Waste Lands takes our group to a city called Lud on the outskirts of the waste lands.  The group believes they need to find a monorail named Blaine in the city and he will help them on their journey to the Dark Tower.  Once they enter the city much goes wrong and we are introduced to a really cool but really evil character called the Tick-Tock Man who runs Lud.

I work at Barnes & Noble and am in charge of both the Teen and Childrens sections. When our store sold out of New Moon within a week of initially getting the book my curiosity was piqued -- I felt I had to give its predecessor a try so I knew what the hype was about and could give an honest opinion about the book.Now here I sit and I have finished both Twilight and New Moon. I have to admit -- Meyer has a talent. Both books I read at breakneck speed barely stopping to eat or sleep. Her prose is smooth and easy accompanied by a plot that I found engrossing. I went back after reading Twilight and re-read my favorite sections more than once. The love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive. I definitely plan on recommend this book mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over Edward.However I only gave the book four stars. While I enjoyed it immensley as I read the novel a few things bothered me upon looking back: 1) While Meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy. If I had to read one more time about Edwards marble angelic face (what exactly does that mean??) his liquid topaz eyes or how Bella glared at Edward I thought I was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane.2) Im not sure I buy their romance. It was heartstopping and climactic during the read but honestly what DOES he see in her? If Bella keeps asking that question to herself maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it. 3)Bella herself bothered me. I found Bella to be horribly dependent on Edward to the point that I got irritated with her. And her constantly having to catch her breath around Edward -- Puh-leeze.

This was my favorite Grisham book followed by The Firm Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  I found the Broker to be too much of an Italian lesson the Brethern simplistic and The Street Lawyer was a giant sermon about helping homeless people - with very little story holding it together.  If you like the Firm you will like The Partner,4.0,4.0,John Grisham,wont spoil ending some many other reviewers didnt like twist however reader who needs have everything wrapped up 100 happy should read runaway jury however like firm another great book ends characters run trouble book very realistic ending didnt expect favorite grisham book followed firm runaway jury pelican brief found broker too much italian lesson brethern simplistic street lawyer giant sermon about helping homeless people very little story holding together if like firm like partner

However after reading this novel I am a stronger proponent of it than ever.  Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor.  Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap one he cant refuse partly because the parents of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money.Give Carter a taste of money then the greed sets in.  For the middle half of the book we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life!  Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients.  This is what will be his undoing.  One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer.  This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months.Grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise and especially his fall.  That shows to the quality of his storytelling.  In fact while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character he mostly is not!  Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story.  The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice.  Too bad such justice doesnt often happen in the real world of mass torts,2.0,2.0,John Grisham,here disclaimer already proponent tort reform before read book however after reading novel am stronger proponent than ever enter clay carter unknown defender dc poorest poor then nice juicy settlement falls into his lap one cant refuse partly because parents his longtime girlfriend pressuring him regarding his moneygive carter taste money then greed sets middle half book get see unadulterated greed come run his life especially infuriating how lets greed come before wellbeing his clients what his undoing one his clients who already ticked off settlement made gets terminal illness decides go after his lawyer rags riches almost rags course about eighteen monthsgrisham actually makes feel sympathetic main charater clay carter through his rise especially his fall shows quality his storytelling fact while carter some ways sympathetic character mostly not mass torts greed theme story fact came back haunt him only justice too bad such justice doesnt often happen real world mass torts

Poirier,Ottawa ON Canada,This book is rather different. Although its about Copernicus book De Revolutionibus very little astronomy is discussed. There is also very little about Copernicus himself. The main theme of the book is finding as many still-existing copies of Copernicus book as possible and describing each one in detail - the ultimate purpose being the publication of a so-called census of that ancient book i.e. a snapshot in time that identifies and describes each individual copy and where it is located in the world. Since I know nothing about antique book collecting I learned a lot on this field by reading this book. I was not aware of all the work and travel required in finding a given copy of a book especially identifying the authors of any hand-written notes on its pages. I did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous but some of the authors adventures are quite intriguing particularly where he makes use of his notes to identify possibly stolen copies that eventually surface at auctions or elsewhere. Some aspects of life and technology in the sixteenth century that are important for the theme of this book as well as discussions of some of Copernicus contemporaries are touched upon. But as the author states this book is really a memoir of his census project. I think that this book would be of most interest to those with a passion for ancient books and ancient book collecting.,2.0,2.0,Owen Gingerich,book rather different although about copernicus book de revolutionibus very little astronomy discussed there also very little about copernicus himself main theme book finding many stillexisting copies copernicus book possible describing each one detail ultimate purpose being publication socalled census ancient book ie snapshot time identifies describes each individual copy where located world since know nothing about antique book collecting learned lot field reading book not aware all work travel required finding given copy book especially identifying authors any handwritten notes pages did find certain lengthy descriptions rather monotonous some authors adventures quite intriguing particularly where makes use his notes identify possibly stolen copies eventually surface auctions or elsewhere some aspects life technology sixteenth century important theme book well discussions some copernicus contemporaries touched upon author states book really memoir his census project think book would most interest passion ancient books ancient book collecting

She speaks about the rights of the First Amendment pertaining to free speech and provides a detailed history of how censorship has become a part of the textbooks and tests that have been developed.  The book is informative and thought- provoking.	Ravitch starts by discussing the creation of bias and sensitivity boards and how they have come to dominate what can and cannot be said in certain literature for education.  She goes on to talk about certain topics and words that must not be used.  This list is ridiculous and completely irrational.  Due to left and right wing intervention almost everything of interest has been stripped from the educational requirements.  Ravitch discusses in great detail the effort of both sides and what their motives were in demanding that certain changes be made in textbooks and tests.  She goes further to detail the goals of each side and how they were met.  She argues that such censorship keeps children from learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint a picture of Utopia and keep children from feeling any emotions.  	Ravitch presents a good convincing argument with concrete reasoning to support her views.  To the best of my knowledge and research she has done a great job at gathering accurate information about what has been going on in publishing companies and the struggles they have faced from bias and sensitivity reviews feminists minorities and other groups.  Her reasoning is inductively strong with few logical fallacies.  Occasionally Ravitch begs the question through circular reasoning and attacks the motives of some publishing companies.  Although she has clear concise points Ravitch intermittently distorts the timeline within chapters which is slightly confusing.  ,2.0,2.0,Diane Ravitch,diane ravitch discusses development censorship textbooks tests been slowly integrated into educational system she speaks about rights first amendment pertaining free speech provides detailed history how censorship become part textbooks tests have been developed book informative thought provoking ravitch starts discussing creation bias sensitivity boards how have come dominate what can cannot said certain literature education she goes talk about certain topics words must not used list ridiculous completely irrational due left right wing intervention almost everything interest been stripped educational requirements ravitch discusses great detail effort both sides what motives demanding certain changes made textbooks tests she goes further detail goals each side how met she argues such censorship keeps children learning historically accurate facts because adults would rather paint picture utopia keep children feeling any emotions ravitch presents good convincing argument concrete reasoning support her views best knowledge research she done great job gathering accurate information about what been going publishing companies struggles have faced bias sensitivity reviews feminists minorities other groups her reasoning inductively strong few logical fallacies occasionally ravitch begs question through circular reasoning attacks motives some publishing companies although she clear concise points ravitch intermittently distorts timeline within chapters which slightly confusing

Cece is more than happy for an excuse to meet the eccentric millionaire collector. They strike up an immediate friendship and after showing her his collection he shows her something really special--a nude portrait of the model who posed for the original Nancy Drew covers. Cece is scheduled to give a luncheon speech at a Nancy Drew convention in nearby Palm Springs and Edward invites her to use his vacation house there. Delighted at her good fortune Cece packs up herself and her two friends Lael and Bridget a boatload of vintage clothes (which she collects though she told Edgar she collected nothing) and head for a fun girls weekend. Unfortunately someone throws a kink into their plans--a big kink. A dead body. Edgars body. The suspects are many including Edgars boy-toy friend and his majordomo; a wild-eyed Nancy Drew fanatic who wouldnt have wanted that nude painting made public; her less-than-honest performance artist daughter; Bridgets new boy-toy boyfriend; a shi-shi art dealer. And of course Cece herself who could have endeared herself to the police had she not insisted on solving the mystery herself. But her curiosity about the model in the nude painting the artist who did the painting and anything connected to Nancy Drew gets the better of her. The second in the Cece Caruso series is a fun fast-paced puzzler and Cece and her chums give Nancy a run for her money.

MacDonald,Baltimore MD,I consider myself an optimist and insightful person but somehow managed to miss many of Postrels insights. She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought. She does keep that hope in check though by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat instead of the blessing that it is. She thoroughly destroys the notion that there is nothing new under that sun. While the universe therefore our earth is necessarily finite we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in. For example a deck of cards has only 52 cards but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x...x3x2x1 which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe! So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards you can rest assured that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence... ever. People are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things. Obviously there will always be new things. Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history science technology etc. its safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about. We need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can. It will only make our lives better on the whole. There will always be setbacks but as long as people can think we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks. The book is a stunning intelligent look at modern life.

Knowles,Vermont,I first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990s. It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion. Like many a cynic I asked myself Now whos this guy and whats he spinning? Against my natural inclination to dismiss it I ordered POG. On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed: here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God.Strangely however I couldnt stop reading. Despite months of scrawling angry counter-arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about Gods delight in being God. To make this story short I found myself in the end exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth. And finally happy too with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword.Salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first. The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural (or supernatural) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration.This is not a critical analysis of POG; others have provided that sufficiently on this page. Instead its a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where Gods glory was seen...and is now sung.,15.0,16.0,John Piper,first saw book reviewed early 1990s aroused double response curiosity suspicion like many cynic asked myself now whos guy whats spinning against natural inclination dismiss ordered pog receiving began reading found suspicions confirmed here another triumphal insensitive adherent doctrine sovereignty godstrangely however couldnt stop reading despite months scrawling angry counterarguments margins pages drawn inexplicably sensibility core premise about gods delight being god make story short found myself end exhausted surrendered portrait god piper paints full palette scriptural truth finally happy too beginnings joy piper wished his sons forewordsalvation history testifies fact distinguishing evidence truth often hated first fact pog eventually had such unnatural or supernatural effect someone like initially so inclined resist rebuff speaks more validity book than if had joined immediately chorus deserved admirationthis not critical analysis pog others have provided sufficiently page instead personal account irresistible grace against all nature drew small scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where gods glory seenand now sung

1688,0520241509:involved_very_scholarly_work_on_the_20th_cent._mideast:david_w._nicholas,520241509,The Modern Middle East: A Political History since the First World War: Books: Mehran Kamrava,books,4,Involved very scholarly work on the 20th Cent. MidEast,April 6 2006,David W. Nicholas,Montrose CA USA,This is the sort of book I have been looking for a long time. Ive read other books on the Middle East which purport to have a similar focus but which are instead incomplete notably Sowing the Wind. This book by contrast maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region. It looks as if the book was written as a textbook for (I would presume) grad students studying the subject but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal.An issue with a book like this is the tone of the work how well the author writes. Kamrava isnt the second coming of Hemingway but hes not too bad either. The book is divided into two portions: first a historical section that gives you an overview of the regions history and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently. The first section is very readable the second less so (who actually enjoys reading about economics?). The author however does a good job (for the most part) of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something though he does occasionally use words that are obscure especially in terms of sub-regions of the Mid East.I still enjoyed this book thought I got a lot out of it and would recommend it. The author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than I am but he makes a good case for his point of view and the result is interesting,9.0,11.0,Mehran Kamrava,sort book have been looking long time ive read other books middle east which purport have similar focus which instead incomplete notably sowing wind book contrast maintains focus rather carefully provides concise history whole region looks if book written textbook would presume grad students studying subject really any intelligent person can pick up learn great dealan issue book like tone work how well author writes kamrava isnt second coming hemingway hes not too bad either book divided into two portions first historical section gives overview regions history second topical section looks various issues impact region currently first section very readable second less so who actually enjoys reading about economics author however does good job most part not sounding like university professor telling about something though does occasionally use words obscure especially terms subregions mid easti still enjoyed book thought got lot out would recommend author seems hair more optimistic about prospects peace prosperity region than am makes good case his point view result interesting

But even if youre not new to dating this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone (emotionally) during the dating process and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom otherwise you could end up having a wonderful relationship.I especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship (or who are thinking that they thought they were) with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden.  If you are questioning things like where did he go? why didnt he call?  why does he seem so distant now?  what did I do wrong? - you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere.  And likewise I recommend this to men who feel that theyve come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden arent sure anymore are feeling anxious or maybe even trapped and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure worries more questions you more starts pressuring you more about commitment etc.  All of these situations emotions etc. are explained in this book.  Youre not the only one - its a normal part of dating - but unfortunately most of us wont possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book.Even if ,1.0,1.0,John Gray,whether new dating widowed or divorced starting date again or 50th year marriage able gleam something book impact life positive wayideally could read book before embark upon dating chapter life even if youre not new dating book can make amazing positive impact many ways can increase chances finding right person reduce chances being hurt or hurting someone emotionally during dating process help avoid scaring away someone whom otherwise could end up having wonderful relationshipi especially recommend women who relationship or who thinking thought man who seems have changed all sudden if questioning things like where did go why didnt call why does seem so distant now what did do wrong possibly point relationship where choice actions can make or break relationship might just edge going somewhere likewise recommend men who feel theyve come point relationship where all sudden arent sure anymore feeling anxious or maybe even trapped same time there strong need just get away think andor if woman dating seems have become more insecure worries more questions more starts pressuring more about commitment etc all situations emotions etc explained book youre not only one normal part dating unfortunately most us wont possibly able understand without someone else pointing out us like gray done bookeven if

After the first part Perhaps an Accident my expectations had completely altered. As I read through the second part Marquesa de Montemeyor my expectations were slowly changing even more. By the beginning of the third part Esteban my expectations had transformed so much they were hardly recognizable. I came into it expecting a novel about a man of religions struggle with faith. By the first few pages I came to realize it had much more of a non-fiction lean at this point I was scared of being bored. As I started to read part two I began to realize it wasnt about this Brother Juniper at all but the people in the accident. Throughout parts of the first chapter I have to admit I did feel bored but near the end it caught fire and I was wowed by the first parts finish. This reinvested my firm belief that the ending of a short story will completely redeem it for thats what each part was: a short story telling the complete life of one of the victims in the accident of the bridge.The story of Thornton Wilders Pulitzer Prize winner is that a bridge (the finest bridge in all of Peru) snapped and five travelers fell to their death. Brother Jupiter decided to use this accident to prove that it was Gods will. This man found it more difficult than he expected discovering an ambiguity in life that he had not seen. Basically the novel to me is detailing the complexity and mystery of life.I would say the way The Bridge of San Luis Rey was written was generally not exceptionally appealing to me. It was told almost exactly like a textbook account of the events. Using this method though there were dazzling moments when the book flowed like poetry. The book also seemed slightly tedious at times. Certain sections were difficult to get through but as I pressed on I felt a certain gratification in knowing that I was being shown ,2.0,3.0,Thornton Wilder,came into book expecting one thing after first part perhaps accident expectations had completely altered read through second part marquesa de montemeyor expectations slowly changing even more beginning third part esteban expectations had transformed so much hardly recognizable came into expecting novel about man religions struggle faith first few pages came realize had much more nonfiction lean point scared being bored started read part two began realize wasnt about brother juniper all people accident throughout parts first chapter have admit did feel bored near end caught fire wowed first parts finish reinvested firm belief ending short story completely redeem thats what each part short story telling complete life one victims accident bridgethe story thornton wilders pulitzer prize winner bridge finest bridge all peru snapped five travelers fell death brother jupiter decided use accident prove gods man found more difficult than expected discovering ambiguity life had not seen basically novel detailing complexity mystery lifei would say way bridge san luis rey written generally not exceptionally appealing told almost exactly like textbook account events using method though there dazzling moments when book flowed like poetry book also seemed slightly tedious times certain sections difficult get through pressed felt certain gratification knowing being shown

The boom will hit us in industries that we have competitive advantage in and will then expand into the financial sector once enough excess labor is absorbed in the competitive advantage industries that wages go up as companies compete for workers.  Since so many of our publicly-traded companies outsource and have significant overseas manufacturing operations they are using that cost-savings in order to finance the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley.  The net effect is that Sarbanes-Oxley is being digitally enforced throughout the global operations of U.S. publicly-traded companies.  This is part of the reason why you hear of increasing unrest in many emerging markets.  Large portions of their economies are being reshuffled in order to digitally align with our securities laws.

But do you know the rest of the story?  Heres a chance to find out.Mr. Siegel became a father for the first time at age 54 and his son Dylan was born on the day Mr. Siegel finished chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.  That cancer later spread to his lungs and two more cancer surgeries and treatments followed.  Mr. Siegels marriage did not last but his love for Dylan did.  Realizing that his chances of living to see Dylan grow up are limited Mr. Siegel decided to write down all of the wonderful things he wanted to share with Dylan over the next few decades . . . but might not be able to.  The result is a touching memoir with a heart that will cause you to shed more than an occasional tear while appreciating Mr. Siegels love for his son.Mr. Siegel writes well has had many interesting experiences and retains his sense of wonder.  He is open about many of his faults (which have led to failed marriages) but remains cautiously optimistic . . . and careful.Dedicating the material to his son makes the memoir more personal and meaningful than almost any other memoir that I have read.  Anyone with an open heart would enjoy and benefit from this book.If you are like me you expected to mainly hear about the movies . . . and you will.  But theres much more in the book about Mr. Siegels family Jewish heritage (theres even a Yiddish dictionary with hilarious definitions) illnesses past marriages and advice for Dylan.

He tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life.  You get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire.  Its scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost Germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds.  When he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow.  Its amazing that Wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred but maybe even more amazing that he doesnt embellish the situations.  There is little reflection on an event because hes off describing the next firefight or lost buddy.  The most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field.  It was not only unfair but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting didnt know the difference.   The title refers to a commander who told Wilson before he went into battle that hed be promoted if he survived.  The promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he doesnt seem that upset about his treatment.

Rueda,,In 2003 I suffered my worst major depression ever. It lasted for over a year and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that I wished I were dead. Again the worst part was when I couldnt even get a full nights rest and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching... Having to get up in the morning was hell. Needless to say I couldnt work and that increased my ill-feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four (we have two adolescent kids).  Reading Andrew Solomons book which I found recommended at depression-blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience because for the first time ever I found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression. In my illness I found that psychiatrists doctors and other therapists who havent themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply cannot understand what it is like. Its just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange: no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes the other person will have no real understanding unless he/she eats one him/herself. Same with friends and well-wishers of many sorts who will tell you things like Cheer up! or Make an effort! without realizing that thats precisely what you would most want to do -but cant.  Solomons book and the advise of Mike S. -now a friend and the guy who created the depression-blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me.

Holmes,books,4,Setting the record straight,June 15 2006,Karen Potts,Lake Jackson Texas,When considering the faith of the founders of the U.S it is easy to rely on half-truths and assumptions.  David Holmes dispels a lot of myths in his well-researched book which uses historical documentation personal letters and observations of conduct in order to describe the various beliefs which the early patriots espoused.  He begins by describing the religious movements of the 18th. century which influenced our founders.  One interesting point he makes is that 9 of the original colonies had government-sponsored churches a practice which the country quickly abandoned when the colonies united into a nation.  Although many of the people he describes including George Washington Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were brought up in orthodox Christian churches such as Episcopal and Congregational they were later influenced by the Deist movement which opposed many orthodox Christian views.  He describes some interesting practices such as the fact that George Washington would leave Anglican services before participating in communion despite the fact that his wife Martha would stay for the sacrament.  This is only one example of an early political wife who stayed true to her orthodox upbringing despite the Deist leanings of her husband.  Holmes concludes his book with a brief description of modern-day presidents and their religious beliefs which bear much more scrutiny than the founding fathers did.

For all Christian believers the richness and power of Brother Lawrences lifes witness and words are a fountain of Truth a treasure that is as elegant (spiritually) as it is simple.  For the non-believers I am afraid that reading this booklet (a spiritual treasure in disguise) will just confirm St. Paul the Apostless words that the message of the cross is ... foolishness to the Gentiles (1 Corinthians. 1:18 23 and 2:14).The only way to do justice to this booklet is to quote from it and let you get a taste of it ...This is a unique biography because it is not compiled by the Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (birth name Nicholas Herman but known by his monastic name) but by the ones around his life in 17th century France.  Thus one learns very little about the beginnings of his life but very much about his godly lifestyle in the last 30 years of life of bliss (presence of God in his heart) and suffering (3 physical and debilitating ailments).

These six people can.,June 17 2006,Zack Davisson,Ikeda Osaka Japan,Its pretty impressive to think that a book like Hiroshima was written and appreciated less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.  John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.Interviewing six survivors Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.  Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.  The color of your clothing means everything.  White clothes reflect the heat while dark clothing absorbs it.  Even if you survive the initial blast what you see next might make you wish you hadnt.  But human beings are stubborn creatures and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.  It is a humbling experience and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.  Herseys book has a similar impact being told in such a clinical observational writing style that you cant help but be moved by the reality of it all.My one criticism of Hiroshima is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.  For some reason they seem to be largely Christian including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.   With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population considerably less than 1% the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.  Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers See? They arent heathen devils.  They are Christians just like you and me.  Thats who we dropped the bomb on. Thats who we killed.   This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was,3.0,3.0,John Hersey,pretty impressive think book like hiroshima written appreciated less than year after atomic bomb dropped john hersey took bold step investigating lives experiences who receiving end birth atomic ageinterviewing six survivors hersey assembled snapshot what like have atomic bomb dropped city pure luck circumstances determine if survive or not color clothing means everything white clothes reflect heat while dark clothing absorbs even if survive initial blast what see next might make wish hadnt human beings stubborn creatures seem keep going even most hellish circumstancesi have been hiroshima peace park several times have seen human face atomic bomb up close personal humbling experience one forever changed opinions war means settling disputes herseys book similar impact being told such clinical observational writing style cant help moved reality allmy one criticism hiroshima cast characters hersey chose showcase some reason seem largely christian including german jesuit priest japanese methodist minister christians being such tiny percentage japanese population considerably less than 1 choice interview japanese christians seems deliberate one hersey telling largelychristian us readers see arent heathen devils christians just like thats who dropped bomb thats who killed puts question journalistic neutrality book hersey light putting across agenda instead simpling reporting what

While not an authentic artifact it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of Americas most successful and controversial social-religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.  This reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of Joseph Smith (Author and Proprietor) to the pen(s) of his various scribes.  When the book is placed in its historical context the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current LDS Church as well as Smiths answers for many of the religious concerns of his day.  Also interestingly when compared to the current version of the book and the LDS Church today the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time.  For Example:  The development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity (see book of 1 Nephi and Mosiah - also see Lectures on Faith also by Smith) to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses (see current version of the Book of Mormon - changing of the text in 1 Nephi to correspond with current church doctrine).  The original condemnation of polygamy (marriage to more than one wife at a time) with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity (see book of Jacob) to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than Smith saying that God commanded the practice then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent Church property from being confiscated and to allow Utah statehood in the union.

We went through the entire book and I have to say it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods. Also the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance Whats for dinner and be ready to prepare it.The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly and you will need to be an open minded eater. If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household this may not be the book for you. Also our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats. Good healthy quality food ingredients but unfortunately painful to the wallet.That said I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one the food is good the variety is there and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond bunless burgers and eggs and bacon.Overall I would recommend Leannes Saving Dinner books. For the open minded foodie. Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list. These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress,1.0,1.0,Leanne Ely,bought book along saving dinner saving dinner holidays last yeari love concept having weekly menu planned out well grocery list put together ready shopping went through entire book have say really broadened our food horizons had been stuck rut long time our regular foods also books really did eliminate lot stress allowing know advance whats dinner ready prepare itthe only cons can think would food not exactly kid friendly need open minded eater if have lot people finicky preferences household may not book also our grocery bill two went up about 75 week 125 because veggies meats good healthy quality food ingredients unfortunately painful walletthat said have never seen low carb book out there compares one food good variety there takes low carb lifestyle above beyond bunless burgers eggs baconoverall would recommend leannes saving dinner books open minded foodie or weeks just want not worry about dinner grocery list books great have do offer good variety recipes broaden horizons while removing some stress
1717,0374173273:reasons_for_being_alone:stranger,374173273,How to Be Alone: Essays: Books: Jonathan Franzen,books,4,Reasons for being alone,August 6 2004,Stranger,Columbus OH,So here is a collection of essays by Jonathan Franzen the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001 The Corrections. Many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as Harpers and The New Yorker--so readers should know what theyre getting into. I read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of Franzen as a corporeal human being and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel. Overall I liked most of the essays appearing in this collection. From the promising opener in which Franzen poignantly recounts his fathers slow descension into quietus from Alzheimers we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in America before Ashcroft and the Patriot Act invaded the American lexicon. Why Bother (which was previously referred to as The Harpers Essay) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st Century as a tool of social reform; the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform but should rather be written--ultimately-- for plain old entertainment value Franzen seems to argue. Some of these essays seem to be a little discursive; Franzen evidentally has a lot to say and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are going off on long tangents; such as in Mr. Difficult where as some other reviewer stated he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be pretentious but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author William Gaddis.Franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary without pontificating or being too offensively forward. People may consider Franzen an elitist but I consider him to posses a well-read inquisitive mind; there are far too few Jonathan Franzens around these days,2.0,2.0,Jonathan Franzen,so here collection essays jonathan franzen wizard who brought us highly intelligent acutely mesmerizing novel 2001 corrections many essays originally appeared literati mags such harpers new yorkerso readers should know what theyre getting into read book mainly attempt try get sense franzen corporeal human being not just some exalted author awardwinning novel overall liked most essays appearing collection promising opener which franzen poignantly recounts his fathers slow descension into quietus alzheimers progress quasiportentous pronouncement dangerous state privacy america before ashcroft patriot act invaded american lexicon why bother which previously referred harpers essay interesting rumination inevitable failure novel 21st century tool social reform novel should not used way engender social reform should rather writtenultimately plain old entertainment value franzen seems argue some essays seem little discursive franzen evidentally lot say seems forget what initial point his arguments going off long tangents such mr difficult where some other reviewer stated begins interesting exploration his artistic need pretentious then slowly veers off into history ode author william gaddisfranzen once again proves smart sophisticated reader writer book perfectly showcases his aptitude social commentary without pontificating or being too offensively forward people may consider franzen elitist consider him posses wellread inquisitive mind there far too few jonathan franzens around days

And were I not slightly dissapointed with this particular edition of the novel I would have given it 5 stars without a doubt. It is a fabulous story I would recommend it to anyone. [As a small sidenote -- I would simply like to say that Wildes particular style of writing is one which I do in general find rather enjoyable.]I have heard some people say that they found this book diffucult to muddle through. I was not one of these people. Also The other stories in this book are not bad at all. I enjoyed The Happy Prince quite thoroughly. - *note this particular fairy tale was very reminiscent of Hans Christian Andersons writings. THE FLAW(S)! I blame the editor for this one -- this book as far as I have been able to find does not include the alternate(slightly more drawn-out) ending to this novel. I was needless to say a little upset by this missing detail. (If I have merely overlooked this extended ending by all means let me know) ANOTHER SMALL FLAW - If you have not read the book DO NOT i repeat DO NOT begin by reading the AUTHORS NOTE. Although the authors note was very insightful and generally enjoyable to read - it easily gives away more than half the plot. The authors note is a spoiler -- BEWARE. Overall  still a great novel.

It took me a while to read it about 2 months because its definitely not fast paced.  I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is pride and Elizabeth Bennett is prejudice.  These two are made for each other unbeknown to themselves.  This is essentially the story of how they fall in love with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy.  He is the perfect gentleman.  He is readily willing to admit his own faults when they are brought to his knowledge.  He also doesnt retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didnt do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful.  She is doubtful about people and quite cynical.  I really like that about her.  It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly.  This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him.  Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself.  I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through but once I got into it I couldnt wait to see what happened next even though I already knew the story.

The idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one I found appealing but the plot was at times predictable. The setting was well-drawn but most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional. The clincher though is that Im not sure yet just how captivating Anna Pigeon is as a main character. I believe that this is her first story so I dont want to make a snap judgement but Anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple. That would be expecting a lot I know but frankly she isnt even as engaging as say Gideon Oliver or Sharon McCone or Brother Cadfael and she lacks the depth and power of a Harry Bosch.As I said the jury is still out for me here. I liked TRACK OF THE CAT but I wasnt wild about it. Its a solid first try and Ill certainly read another Anna Pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series. I expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable.

I also attended the Guerilla Business School a $2500 intensive.  What is important to realize is that actually being in a room in the workshops and doing it several days in a row will actually (as it did with me) shift your perspective if you are at all open to having it shifted.    Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones.  This book may help you but the seminar will help you more.  The Millionaire Mind intensive taught me things and set in motion a change in perpective for me.

1726,0192815245:one_of_my_favorite_books:robert_j._nelson,192815245,The Monk (Worlds Classics): Books: Matthew G. LewisHoward Anderson,books,5,One Of My Favorite Books,December 20 2005,Robert J. Nelson,The Woodlands Tx United States,This is one of my favorite books of all time and during my 40 years of life Ive read a lot of them.  First off: the style is simple and direct - no big words and no long sentences. But this is by no means to imply that it is unsophisticated. As the product of a 19-20 year old mind it impresses. It reads very much like a modern novel. This is the kind of novel you wish you could have written yourself - at any age let alone 19 or 20. As such it is remarkable.Secondly: the subject matter is disturbing yet something that must be taught. Educated people should know how easy it is to become a hypocrite when how one behaves is determined solely by how he believes the public will react. Matthew Lewis was not concerned about this. This is what makes him such a great writer. Too many contemporary authors are more motivated to write what they believe the public will like than what is in their hearts. Lewis book created a sensation when it was published. He probably realized that he was writing a controversial book but he believed strongly that what he had to say was the truth and that it should be said. After all he was writing during the French Revolution while the Reign of Terror was raging in Paris. People were just beginning to become disillusioned with Reason (because of what they felt it had led to in France) but had yet to become infatuated with sentimentality and passion (as they would during the Romantic era). As such then it was a time of transition. Lewis must have been aware of the danger (as he saw it) of people turning back (as they had during the Middle Ages) to Religion for answers in a time of such upheaval. He obviously felt that more Religion was not the answer that too much Religion can pervert the mind just as too much Reason can. This is why his work is still relevant today. The battle over what role Religion is to play in society still rages today.These are only a few thoughts ,1.0,2.0,Matthew G.

Barrie,books,5,Why Classics are Classics,October 8 2006,Scott Boom-Body,Texas,As one reads Peter Pan one doesnt have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim.  I had ridiculously high expectations of Mr. Barries imagination before purchasing this title and he has fulfilled them completely.Many parts of the story are nothing but nonsense which I enjoy above all else.  Mr. Darling the head of the Darling family commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine hes supposed to take.  He brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs.  Unfortunately for him during his bragging his medicine is found and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three.  Sure enough when three is reached everyone except Mr. Darling takes their medicine and Mr. Darling once again tries to hide his.This kind of scenario is what Id call Mark Twain nonsense.  You can imagine it being true even though its quite high up on the ridiculous scale.  Then theres what I would classify as over-the-top nonsense - AKA bull - which there is plenty of in Barries original story of Peter Pan.  Going back to Mr. Darling if we take a look at how hes doing near the end of the book we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel.  Ah yes...grown men in pet taxis.  What could be more fun than the he-didnt-even-try-to-make-this-belivable silliness of such a scene?  To be honest I dont know if Id even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this.Other silly parts of the book involve Wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls; the narrator claiming he hates Mrs. Darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later; the lost boys asking Wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it; the narrator using the phrase woke into life because Peter likes the word woke more than wakened; and my favorite Captain Hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark.,,,J.

You have to understand that those of us Back East think that California food is understated and so easy.   Now not being a huge chef myself but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chefs recipes (my fave restaurants being of course Boulevard and back east 2941 Le Tire Bouchon Maestro Citronelle DC Galileo Inn at Little Washington etc.).  I have no clue where Id get some of the ingredients in this cookbook other than maybe the San Francisco Ferry buildings fabulous farmers market (another real SF treat!).  But to be real we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients.  Do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised.  Now I was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at Boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and I have her handwriting -- just ingredients no measurements.  And yes Ive been able to improvise and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of recipes.   But nothing is better than going to the restaurant.   Cookbooks are fab and fun but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals (herselves) are even more exciting.  Buy this book even just for the photographs as Ive never been in a more well-decorated and well-thought-out restaurant.

They are interdependent. IT systems automate the business processes and run 24 by 7. Therefore we cannot really view those who work at the Business level as above us.  So I disagree with the author on this point. However he does sort of make a U turn later on in the book.This book will make you think. For instance: What is the supply demand for programmers in a particular Business domain? This would be a good question to research so that we can plan our career.He talks about how to survive layoffs by being knowledgeable in different areas. Not everyone wants to stay in one organization for a long time. Another thing is that it is almost impractical to learn everything in a particular technology (say Java technology). Developers will have different intentions for example they might have a backup plan in case of IT downturn either by having a cash cushion or generating cash flow through software products.I agree about following your passion. It enables us to transcend limitations. It inspires us and makes us reach a level of performance that amazes us. This explains the previous paragraph (which sounds like excuses).Another principle that he explains - Be the Worst is very real. Two projects one early in my career where I had the opportunity to work with a strong and talented team of developers and project manager. Recently when I found working for people who were not anywhere near my capabilities they did affect my performance.This book helps to see and expect what the work environment could possibly bring us and what we can do to proactively handle these situations.Maintenance is seen as a menial work and recruiters downplay any experience on it.

1732,0963473263:a_modern_day_search_for_the_truth_-_with_disheartening_results:matthew_bryde,963473263,Quest for the Gold Plates: Books: Stan Larson,books,5,A modern day search for the truth - with disheartening results,September 28 2006,Matthew Bryde,Australia,I have spent a lot of time and money researching into Mormon history. The big problem is that as Henry Ford once said History is bunk. With Joseph Smith and the history of the Mormon church there are hundreds of accounts that argue that he was an inspired prophet and just as many an ingenious charlatan. There are even accounts that avoid making a judgement either way and leave it up to the reader to decide. Hence using history as a basis for discovering the truth about the history of Joseph Smith can be a very frustrating (and sometimes expensive) exercise. The Church itself avoids encouraging the study of historical events to gain testimony but instead promotes the individual member to gain a spiritual testimony. It is easy to see from my statement above why.This book takes a completely different approach in investigating the truthfulness of what Joseph Smith produced. Forget about what might have happened in the early 1800s and instead focus on the actual record contained in the Book of Mormon itself. Let current day investigation be the basis for the search of truth instead of historical personal accounts. This removes any bias of the source material and hence allows for an objective study.Thomas Stuart Ferguson starts out as the Book of Mormons most enthusiastic proponent. He sacrifices a large portion of his life both petitioning the First Presidency for financial support and performing extensive archaeological expeditions to find evidence of the civilisations documented in the Book of Mormon (BofM). While he expects an abundance of material to be discovered he finds none. Nothing. No evidence of the language or writings contained within the BofM the animals and crops mentioned artefacts city names weapons metals glass etc. Nothing for the period documented within the BofM (2500 BC - 400 AD). There are few discoveries outside this timeline but none within.,2.0,2.0,Stan Larson,have spent lot time money researching into mormon history big problem henry ford once said history bunk joseph smith history mormon church there hundreds accounts argue inspired prophet just many ingenious charlatan there even accounts avoid making judgement either way leave up reader decide hence using history basis discovering truth about history joseph smith can very frustrating sometimes expensive exercise church itself avoids encouraging study historical events gain testimony instead promotes individual member gain spiritual testimony easy see statement above whythis book takes completely different approach investigating truthfulness what joseph smith produced forget about what might have happened early 1800s instead focus actual record contained book mormon itself let current day investigation basis search truth instead historical personal accounts removes any bias source material hence allows objective studythomas stuart ferguson starts out book mormons most enthusiastic proponent sacrifices large portion his life both petitioning first presidency financial support performing extensive archaeological expeditions find evidence civilisations documented book mormon bofm while expects abundance material discovered finds none nothing no evidence language or writings contained within bofm animals crops mentioned artefacts city names weapons metals glass etc nothing period documented within bofm 2500 bc 400 ad there few discoveries outside timeline none within

And of course those firms charge hefty fees even if their timing is slightly off (say a few years or so).   Another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years. If only he had read the book in 1999.   What is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by Wall Streeters with whom you cannot compete and beat over time. Some of the smartest people in the world work on the Street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody. But they want you in the game. They need you. They take care of their biggest clients (and I mean really big) and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave usually at a loss. Because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell. Which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time. Every winning trade requires a losing trade. Too bad past results are no etc. etc.   Try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw. And its consequences. Everybody thinks they can get out in time. Trouble is when markets tank--stock market real estate markets--there is no getting out because there are no buyers. Its a free fall without a parachute. Many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year.      The author of this book Ed Eastering is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works. Which is useful in a textbook kind of way. And he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor.    Trouble is timing IS everything and the information you need to time the market is not going,,,Ed Easterling,one reviewer book said hes sick investing tomes offer no practical benefit except enrich authors who usually run money management firms which books meant recruit clients course firms charge hefty fees even if timing slightly off say few years or so another reviewer loved book because realizes going have work harder invest successfully over coming years if only had read book 1999 what not fully understood many investors money game run wall streeters whom cannot compete beat over time some smartest people world work street not sharing what know anybody want game need take care biggest clients mean really big every client who not big late table last leave usually loss because smaller clients start buying what big players just starting sell which why big holders sell dribs drabs over time every winning trade requires losing trade too bad past results no etc etc try work market independently against big guns eventually come know meaning whipsaw consequences everybody thinks can get out time trouble when markets tankstock market real estate marketsthere no getting out because there no buyers free fall without parachute many real estate speculators learn coming year author book ed eastering well respected can give good view how game works which useful textbook kind way attempts lay out some tips solo investor trouble timing everything information need time market not going

1738,0380713330:classic_statement_of_animal_liberation:greg,380713330,Animal Liberation: Books: Peter Singer,books,4,Classic statement of animal liberation,November 23 2006,Greg,Australia,In the 1970s Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics; animal liberation.  While some philosophers and others had in the past argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism) Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals.  Singers primary argument and a very interesting one is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals particularly in the structures of our vital organs nervous systems and brains.  Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering.  On these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights at least when they are being used by humans.  The fact animals can suffer means we cant just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use but we need to consider them as fellow beings.  Singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals using animals in agricultural contexts using animals for scientific experimentation or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products.  Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge including the use of rape racks and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments.  At the end of the book Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example.Singers work has been very powerful in its influence and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work.  However others have criticized his arguments quite strongly on many grounds.  It has also become a kind of manifesto for many ,,,Peter Singer,1970s peter singer came out radical argument which new field ethics animal liberation while some philosophers others had past argued necessity being kind animals schopenhauer probably being most notable case because his deep respect buddhism peter singer probably first philosopher western philosophy set out systematic rational set arguments regarding rights animals singers primary argument very interesting one science demonstrated show very close connections many kinds animals particularly structures our vital organs nervous systems brains singer gathers some strong evidence biology showing how many animal species apparently capable feeling pain hence suffering grounds singer argues animals entitled certain rights least when being used humans fact animals can suffer means cant just treat them another form material object or resource our use need consider them fellow beings singer builds up set arguments against eating animals using animals agricultural contexts using animals scientific experimentation or using animals commercial research such testing cosmetic products singer draws some infamous damning experiments which seem have caused terrible pain suffering animals little apparent gain scientific knowledge including use rape racks virtual torture infant monkeys one series experiments end book singer presents several vegetarian recipies hopes readers stop eating meat examplesingers work been very powerful influence several philosophers built expanded his work however others have criticized his arguments quite strongly many grounds also become kind manifesto many

For normal people forget about it. Even if you arent into climbing mountains this book is gripping from page to page and you dont want to put it down. Krakauers first (?) book - Into the Wild is also great but this one is better being a first person account. I remember when this came out and the surrounding backlash that accompanied it from people associated to the dead. Forget them Krakauer gets it right with no hidden agenda unless you count surviving. I would have liked more commentary from the surviving members though. And not to state the obvious to everyone else but me but why do they leave the bodies on the mountain ? They risk their lives to rescue the affirmed or injured living but once theyre dead they just leave them there ? Whats up with that ?,,,Jon Krakauer,after reading account acension everest gotta wonder why anybody would want really worth thrill seaking personality course normal people forget about even if arent into climbing mountains book gripping page page dont want put down krakauers first book into wild also great one better being first person account remember when came out surrounding backlash accompanied people associated dead forget them krakauer gets right no hidden agenda unless count surviving would have liked more commentary surviving members though not state obvious everyone else why do leave bodies mountain risk lives rescue affirmed or injured living once theyre dead just leave them there whats up
1742,0739326791:emotional_intelligence_10_years_on:elephantschild_chris,739326791,Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships (Random House Large Print): Books: Daniel Goleman,books,4,Emotional Intelligence 10 years on,November 24 2006,Elephantschild Chris,Paris,There is about as much additional science in Social Intelligence compared to Emotional Intelligence as you could write on a postcard : mirror neurones and spindle cells.   Nevertheless we can be thankful that Daniel Goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way.  Firstly it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to best-seller awareness which is goodness.  Secondly it re-casts them more clearly in an inter-personal format.  Note that this already existed in Emotional Intelligence but was not so clearly called out.

While he occasionally covers nationally significant events Hiaasen generally confines his writings to the fertile territory that is the state of Florida. Readers of Hiaasens columns know well his passions and viewpoints. His sarcastic commentaries often take aim at such topics as the medical profession land developers crooked politicians gun aficionados tobacco companies madcap theme parks and the destruction of Floridas environment. But weekly newspaper pieces are not the end of Hiaasens caustic observations --- they are only the beginning. In 10 novels written over a span of 20 years Hiaasen has expanded upon all of these topics in hilarious tales that poke fun at every aspect of life in the Sunshine State.NATURE GIRL is Hiaasens 11th novel. While he skewers many familiar targets there are a few new objects of ridicule for his skillful and entertaining writing. Hiaasens Florida romps all share common traits: quirky plots countless screwball characters and an irreverent style that creates laughter on every page. The prime target for his ire in NATURE GIRL is Boyd Shreave a telemarketer pitching Florida real estate who places a sales call to Honey Santana thereby setting in motion a chain of events familiar to any Hiaasen aficionado. Anyone who has experienced the pain of a telemarketing call interrupting a quiet and peaceful evening at home can identify with Santanas plot of revenge. She turns the tables on Shreave and lures the unsuspecting pitchman to Florida for a phony tour of nonexistent Florida property.NATURE GIRL begins with an event not uncommon in a Hiaasen novel: someone dies and someone else tries to dispose of the body.

Or so he thinks until he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis. While on leave he falls desperately in love with Savannah the proverbial girl of his dreams. Sweet intelligent and giving John knows hell always carry her torch.When September 11 changes the world John is no exception. Moved by patriotic loyalty he chooses to re-up in the army adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to Savannah. More promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father.This is the story of how an ideal love can falter despite its purity and strength. Not every romance results in a happy ending but with a great deal of luck those who dont survive will find meaning from the experience. Love loyalty friendship--all those sentiments are great but to what cost? And how does this make a good man great? This is Johns journey to that understanding.It goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of todays master storytellers. Part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists. Such is the case in DEAR JOHN. Sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components--well-crafted setting high emotion obstacles resolution--then breaks it. It is from the sadness that hope emerges and John Tyree although still quite young gains wisdom that will last a lifetime. Sorrow will be a large part of this yes but there is room for something more something that will reach beyond the pages and touch Johns tomorrow in a way only he will see.While this works there is something lacking. It is one of those hard-to-define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding.

There are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one. He deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it. Of course there are many negative people who dont like this book because they see everything in black and white. Carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate positive and humane approach to everyone around you. It comes very close to treat the others as you want them to treat you. I am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book the world will be a better place. I am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people. Some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important. His viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. After all genius things are usually simple. Carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples.

His thesis is quite simple: different people had different histories because of geographical (environmental) not innate (racial) differences. He presents develops and defends his point of view brilliantly and forcefully.Some people remained hunters-gatherers while others became masters of the world. The crucial factor in human history is food. The availability of materials (plants animals) for domestication leads to the production of food surpluses in some geographical fertile regions which allowed the feeding of specialists outside agriculture (craftsmen warriors bureaucrats priests kings). Intensive food production population size and societal complexity stimulated each other as fewer peasants were needed to feed the whole population. Craftsmen developed maritime military and industrial technology and warriors conquered new territories. Population growth generated a centralized organization (a state structure) for decision making (politics) and conflict resolutions (law). Domestication provided other cardinal advantages. Infectious diseases evolve from animal diseases. Through intimacy with animals people became immune. But when not immunized populations came in contact with immunized they were wiped out. Also animals could be used as power engines and warrior transport means. Other important historical factors were those related to transmission of acquired knowledge: migration and cardinally writing.While hunter-gatherer groups remained more or less egalitarian states with centralized governments generated great differences of wealth. They became ruled by elite which controlled nearly wholly (kleptocracy) or partially the manna of the state (the budget). But how could the elite continue to control the masses?

Barrow,books,4,Will There Be Pi in The Sky By and By When You Die?,November 3 2001,Bruce Kodish,Pasadena CA United States,Barrow an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics?  What reality do mathematical entities like pi have?  What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called in a now-famous paper &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot; (299)?  After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism inventionism intuitionism and platonism a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor.  Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called &quot;the christian science school of mathematics which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific activities&quot; (Science and Sanity 748).  I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly.  Barrows discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations.  As for Barrows conclusions from a non-aristotelian view the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification the confusion of orders of abstracting.  Barrow doesnt seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics.  He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him.  As Korzybski pointed out we live in a world of multi-dimensional ordered structures or relations.  It does not seem unreasonable then that we can map this world with an exact language,18.0,20.0,John D.

Shaffer,Pennsylvania,I have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.  He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.  Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.  It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagans Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.I have long said that we teach science backward.  We still teach on a 19th Century model.  We start with biology then chemistry and finally physics.Even when I was in high school I wished that I could take physics before chemistry.  Before I was elected as a school board director I was on our districts Gifted Advisory Council.  I made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and then biology last.  I was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics.  So why not teach the math along with the science?  Integrate it.  (No that would make it too relevant.)I felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a Nobel laureate making the same assertion that I had been making for years-we teach science backwards.  After all the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student I know has ever said.  And biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers.Gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first because in this book on chemistry he introduces quantum mechanics which is normally taught as physics on page 28.Dont let he word cartoon in Larry Gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved.

Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel but this novel is so much more than that.  Kelly and Tom have a past but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past.  All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others.  Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend.I think I have yet another author to add to my favorite list.  This novel not only has a suspensful gripping plot but is packed with romance and excitment on many levels.

There are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel and expertly blended to create the whole.  The reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn.

The mystery portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired.  I really didnt understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona.  These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin who clearly stole the show in this book. As a matter of fact of the different plots and stories going on in this book Jules was the best.  It was not only very well-written and sweet but even as a hetrosexual female I could identify with Jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him happens to all of us whether you are in a gay or straight relationship.  I am really hoping that Jules either gets his own book or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness. I do share Ms. Brockmanns opinion when it comes to differences in appearance nationality sexual orientation etc. and I really like how she includes this in her books.

It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles theyre written by actual students. This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year and this is the best guide to colleges among the many Ive seen. I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal shes read in a guide. Among other things she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?

1777,1556523998:the_greatest_book_on_john_lennon:richard_culter,1556523998,The Lives of John Lennon: Books: Albert Goldman,books,5,The Greatest Book on John Lennon,October 29 2005,Richard Culter,Seattle WA,The original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria.  Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono who likened Goldmans book to being punched in the face.  Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldmans book.  Some of Lennons fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty.  Now however the dust has settled and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully.  Each contention of Goldmans which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands.  Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldmans portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user?  That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew Lennon including Ono and Lennons first wife Cynthia Powell.  The same is true about Goldmans claims about Lennons tendency towards violence (a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in his Playboy interview).  And while Ono and others acted agitated over Goldmans depiction of Lennon as bisexual Ono herself is found to have said she considered John Lennon a closet fag in a 1981 interview.  (Why then was Ono so upset by the appearance of Goldmans book?  Because of what it reveals about her.)         It will be clear to anyone who approaches Goldmans book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way.  A perusal at his Sources section reveals his awesome thoroghness.  Goldman bravely explored areas of Lennons and Onos lives that others shied away from out of deference to Ono a worshipful attitude towards Lennon and a reluctance to figure things out.  Albert Goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify Lennon,15.0,17.0,Albert Goldman,original publication lives john lennon 1988 accompanied hysteria much emanated yoko ono who likened goldmans book being punched face yoko close friend jann wenner rolling stone magazine which duly ran article attempting discredit goldmans book some lennons fans took behavior assumed lives john lennon forbidden would not read because doing so would make them naughty now however dust settled lives john lennon holds up beautifully each contention goldmans which alleged outrageous 1988 stands remember ridiculous panic over goldmans portrait lennon heavy drug user drug use now been acknowledged just about everyone who knew lennon including ono lennons first wife cynthia powell same true about goldmans claims about lennons tendency towards violence tendency lennon himself owned up his playboy interview while ono others acted agitated over goldmans depiction lennon bisexual ono herself found have said she considered john lennon closet fag 1981 interview why then ono so upset appearance goldmans book because what reveals about her clear anyone who approaches goldmans book fair mind outrage publication originally sparked unjustified lives john lennon not dishonest or flawed any way perusal his sources section reveals his awesome thoroghness goldman bravely explored areas lennons onos lives others shied away out deference ono worshipful attitude towards lennon reluctance figure things out albert goldman most fearless thorough writer approach subject lives john lennon might overwhelming infantile fans who deify lennon

I would agree as I have reporting experience with MS-Access and Crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly.  If you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book!The bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book.  While this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book.  For example  one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book.  I would agree with that. I was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book. If you want a better reference book try the WROX book Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services.  That book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions.  For example page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it Greenbar Reports.  It was not easy to find in this book either.  How many people would look up Greenbar Reports in the reference?  I was looking into shading alternative rows.  I just happened to stumble upon it.I bought both books together.  Of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at Reporting Services.Reporting Services could use a COOKBOOK-style text like they have for Access and other programming languages.

The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities races ethnicities languages or faiths they still have the same hopes dreams and daily needs.  This is a very important message for children to hear in todays world where there is so much suspicion of those we perceive to be different.  The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere the more tolerant they will be.

He was used to making do. At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian.  Fred knew the country was not a place of peace.  The Rectory had been built in 1830.  Daisy Saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training.  She was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home.  Daisy now known as Saunders was a probationer during her first year.

Elder refused to eat.  The constable had said he was a gentleman.  He asked Daisy if the incident had appeared in the press.  For arranging for a notice about Elders conduct in the newpaper Daisy was dismissed.  Fred Fairly and Daisy were in an accident with bicycles.  A Good Samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health.  Fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate Daisy.  The kindness of the Wrayburns the Samaritans gave Daisy a place to stay in Cambridge.

I find this calendar to be an inspiration in terms of both its beautiful photography and its wonderful geographic diversity. Ive never had a photo published in the Engagement book but Ive probably gathered more inspiration and ideas from these little calendars than from the hundreds of how-to books in my office. The photos in these engagement calendars are the cream of the cream of the crop of the worlds best nature photography. Master photographers like the late Galen Rowell who had many dozens of photos published here consider it one of their finest showcases--and who can blame them. Sierra Club has never relented on the quality of the reproduction of these superb datebooks and considering there are more than 50 photos in each book the price is a bargain.  I have used this calendar as a journal and a diary of my writing progress for literally decades. And whenever my brain starts to freeze after writing about photography for weeks on end and I need a new idea to write about I simply flip through the calendars and I can discover hundreds of them in the work of many of the greatest modern nature-photography masters. Also when Im looking for travel ideas places to go to shoot new pictures for my books I also look here for inspiration and ideas.

Though the book does not follow a chronological order  I could feel the earlier part corresponds to the youthful times in his life (If he ever got old).

Sheets mom of many,Hampton Roads Va,If you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics. I started with Once-a-Month-cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary but though I loved it was a hard days work. Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking! When Deborahs first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low-on-cash short-on-time lifestyle. This book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive. The meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you dont want to heat up the kitchen.My favorites are the Cheese and Chicken Shells (not for everyone however) Chicken Enchiladas (taste great made with homemade whole-wheat tortilla if you do that) Crab rice Chowder (gourmet) Bean Casserole and everyone LOVES Spaghetti Pie. There are lots of good recipes in this book. The drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions I felt that I was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions...that is okay but not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans.

1799,B0007HJOO4:masterpiece_of_western_fiction.:ryan_mcnabb,B0007HJOO4,The Big Sky: Books: A. B. Jr Guthrie,books,5,Masterpiece of Western fiction.,November 21 2004,Ryan McNabb,Ooltewah TN USA,The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece its probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.  This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isnt really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.  The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in cowboy movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.  The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans when actually nothing was further from the truth.  Cowboys were regular working stiffs about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.  They didnt consider themselves free nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.  They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.  But it was backbreaking work and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.I said all that to say that The Big Sky really is about freedom and really is about the West.  Its about the true wild primitive west before the plow before roads when there were still huge intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo.  So its interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no new sherriff in town characters because there are no sherriffs and no towns other than a few trading posts.  There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly,22.0,22.0,A. B.

Not being an easy read it takes some time to get through.  The main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context.  This is quite an achievement considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics.Watson tends to cover science the best and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science including the theories of relativity quantum mechanics scientific cosmology evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene.  However the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy.  Watson dismisses Husserls Phenomenology as abstract and of little importance when in fact Phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy founded by Russell and Wittgeinstein and attracted so many leading European minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory.

1812,0735622442:finally_a_truly_advanced_scripting_book_for_vbscript:alan_finn,735622442,Advanced VBScript for Microsoft  Windows  Administrators: Books: Don JonesJeffery Hicks,books,5,Finally a truly advanced scripting book for VBScript,February 20 2006,Alan Finn,Dallas TX,Having worked with VBScript for a little over four years I am by no means an expert; however I feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting. I was pretty skeptical when I saw the word Advanced in the title but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters.The book begins with securing (including digital certs and policies) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in WMI and ADSI. For me personally the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with WSF and WSC files. Don and Jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind XML functionality as well as its application within the scripted files. These guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies. They wrap up the package peice with explanations around HTAs and form controls in HTML scripts.The book moves on to cover topics such as ADSI and ADO scripting working with WshController and remote scripts WMI and WQL classes and techniques and different applicable real world examples. All this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug sign and package your scripts as well the wizards (WMI ADSI WSF etc) and other tools available to make scripting easier.Ive obtained quite a few VBScript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced VBScripting. If you are new to scripting with VBScript you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods properties classes etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use. While this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it.Thumbs up!

The main chapters are: - Growing Up with Cacao- A Natural and Cultural History of Chocolate- From Cacao to Chocolate- Identifying Cacao- Tasting Chocolate- RecipesThere is also a glossary and a list of companies to order fine chocolate from.  For a beginner like myself who loved chocolate but hadnt progressed much beyond Hersheys with Almonds when I read the book _The New Taste of Chocolate_ was very educational.  It explained the path from cacao bean to chocolate bar and it also explained the difference between dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate.  It explained how cocoa powder comes from chocolate why chocolate is so difficult to make candy with if you dont know what youre doing and why fancier recipes will sometimes specify chocolate manufacturer and cacao percentage.  It was also quite interesting to read about the guidelines for tasting chocolate.  The discussion about criollo forastero and trinitario cacao plants was very fascinating from a scientific standpoint.  I later found that what is true for cacao trees is true for many other types of plants (including wheat): the plants that make the tastiest & highest quality edible parts are also the least productive and most delicate so growers & breeders have to choose whether to grow something that will almost certainly produce a less-desired but still profitable crop or to grow something that has an uncertain yield but is highly profitable should the plant actually produce anything. The recipes were also interesting.  After reading this book I became more adventurous in my chocolate-tasting and started trying some of the European imports I see in the local grocery stores.

This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldnt have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens theyre all screaming each others names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters youve got to have a break! Daniel! Tyler! Helen! Tyler! Daniel! Dad! Helen! Tyler! Give me a break! Otherwise a good story...though not up to the same level as Threshold or Blood of Heaven (definitely better than Eli though).

C.J. Boxs Joe Pickett adventures seem to very in style with each novel.  The initial Open Season was a surreal not quite but almost Carl Hiaasen type novel then Savage Run turned the series into a more traditional thriller type of adventure.  Trophy Hunt introduced a very far fetched paranormal element into the series and as many I was glad when Out of Range returned this series to the traditional believable realistic type thriller a style which continues with In Plain Sight.  I would strongly suggest reading these books in order starting with Open Season as parts of previous novels are given away in subsequent ones and In Plain Sight is certainly no exception to that.

Opal Scarlett the grand and really mean old lady of Thunderhead Ranches has disappeared and perhaps has been the victim of foul play. Tom Wayman an alcoholic fishing guide is brought in as a suspect. Opal in violation of the law charged Wayman and other boaters a fee for navigating the river that runs  through her land. She strung up razor wire across the river and the lazy sheriff thinks a drunken Wayman killed her when he tossed her into the river. Frankly theres not a lot of excitement here.

Sheridan just happens to be the best friend of Jule Scarlett daughter of Hank Scarlett one of two brothers who might be heir to the big ranch. Of course they cant find a will and the two brothers are smashing each other with shovels when Joe arrives to drop off Julie. Julie it turns out doesnt live with her father Hank.

If youve ever wondered what to do with all the herbs youve managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you. If you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly. Not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that I never could have imagined let alone used. The bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful. Each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to its use from root to leaves. The only problem I found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names which unless youre so inclined is difficult to find quickly. This is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable. A page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used. It tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and its uses which includes the medicinal use. Even if I dont use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs. This book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over. A perfect garden companion for that break under a tree. The knowledge can prove to be invaluable. Even such common herbs as Thyme can present posssibly new insights into its benefits. Have trouble sleeping? The leaves of Thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst its many other attributes. There is much more information than I need here but there is something for everyone from herbal dyes to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri.

I have quite a collection and usually go to the library to find new recipes to try before I decide to purchase the entire book.  I normally look for 3 things in a cookbook besides delicious recipes that will work for my family.  This includes: 1)  Pictures of more than 3/4 of the recipes (Color pictures are the best) 2)  A spiral binding or at least one that easily lays flat 3)  New & innovative recipes that have ingredients I can easily find at a grocery storeI also prefer if the cookbook lists all of the nutrient information including sodium fat content protein fiber and carbohydrates.I picked up this book to find new ideas to make a quick meal in-between working and shuffling the kids to various sporting and school events.  Lets face it eating out isnt always the best for you especially since you cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium you are ingesting.  I wanted some new recipes to try but not necessarily a dish that would have my kids eyeing it suspiciously and saying what is it?.  I was not disappointed.The book offered many beautiful color photographs and the pages themselves were glossy and thick...not the cheaper paper that many cookbooks use.  All of the nutrient information was included along with a column called Nutrient Bonus that lets you know if the dish contained a lot of Vitamin C Calcium etc.  The book was hard cover but the binding was loose enough that my copy easily lays flat another good bonus so that I was not always struggling to keep my page open.  It also contains a rather large vegetarian section.Some of our favorites include: Seafood Salad with Citrus Vinaigrette Bistro Beef Salad Vietnamese Style Beef & Noodle Broth Mock Risotto Chicken Stuffed with Golden Onions & Fontina Almond Crusted Chicken Fingers Beer-,12.0,12.0,Jim RomanoffThe Editors of EatingWell,love browse through different cookbooks have quite collection usually go library find new recipes try before decide purchase entire book normally look 3 things cookbook besides delicious recipes work family includes 1 pictures more than 34 recipes color pictures best 2 spiral binding or least one easily lays flat 3 new innovative recipes have ingredients can easily find grocery storei also prefer if cookbook lists all nutrient information including sodium fat content protein fiber carbohydratesi picked up book find new ideas make quick meal inbetween working shuffling kids various sporting school events lets face eating out isnt always best especially since cannot always tell exactly how much fat or sodium ingesting wanted some new recipes try not necessarily dish would have kids eyeing suspiciously saying what not disappointedthe book offered many beautiful color photographs pages themselves glossy thicknot cheaper paper many cookbooks use all nutrient information included along column called nutrient bonus lets know if dish contained lot vitamin c calcium etc book hard cover binding loose enough copy easily lays flat another good bonus so not always struggling keep page open also contains rather large vegetarian sectionsome our favorites include seafood salad citrus vinaigrette bistro beef salad vietnamese style beef noodle broth mock risotto chicken stuffed golden onions fontina almond crusted chicken fingers beer

That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However as Trotsky demonstrates here Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality in a sense it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aimed for and Trotsky defends here is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotskys work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary.

Alcat bel_78,Buenos Aires Argentina,V. I. Lenin wrote this book in 1917 while he was hiding from the Russian government. Lenin pointed out that The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution and of the social revolution to the state like the question of revolution generally was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914). He wanted to correct that oversight and that is probably the main reason why he wrote this book. The State and revolution is a very short book well structured and not difficult to read at all. Initially this pamphlet was going to have seven chapters but Lenin didnt conclude the seventh due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In the postscript to the first edition he explains that saying that due to the reasons already explained the conclusion of the seventh chapters would have to be put off for quite a long time but that all the same It is more pleasant and useful to go through the `experience of revolution than to write about it.The main idea in The State and revolution is that the State is a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms and an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class (a special coercive force that rules through violence). The State of the bourgeoisie will disappear but only through a revolution that will take the people to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat (the working class) will become then the ruling class capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie and of organizing all the working and exploited people for the new economic system. The proletariat needs state power a centralized organization of force an organization of violence both to crush the resistance of the exploiters and to lead the enormous mass of the population -the peasants the petty bourgeoisie and semi-proletarians- in the work of organizing a socialist economy.The,11.0,12.0,V.

The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian I particlularly liked this historical information. Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. This chapter explains clearly the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. The author explains basic trainning principles elements etc. I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. I believe the information Ive gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian how to practce with the jian basic movementsfighting principles and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points internal components and the movement itself. This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again.

It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical; they are not slavish cultists  savoring every last word written by Rand.  They approach the material with  critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rands work in the  larger history of esthetic theory.  They demolish abstract art and devote  considerable energy to discussing Rands definition of art.  They even  propose their own individual alternatives!   If anything shows  independence it is this willingness to debate the differences between the  authors of the same work!  Remarkable!  The world of Rand commentary is  filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship.  That is clear just  by reading one of the reviews here by people who are devotees of certain  &quot;scholars&quot; who do nothing but repeat the catechism.  They take  swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published; that is why  they hate this book.  Because it is independent-minded.  Judge for  yourself.

It has quizes quotes from  other athletes and memory pages. Also it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More  importantly this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says: &quot;Sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle.&quot; This book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is. &quot;Good Sports&quot;  involves &quot;Power Drills&quot; and advice from other girls. It goes  inside the lives of other athletes such as Michelle Kwan but also shows  girlslives who are teens or pre-teens.  This book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game but on the mental part as well: keeping  your dreams alive even when youre at the bottom of the team or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. I would reccommend  &quot;Good Sports&quot; to any female athelete whether you are experienced  or havent even started yet. It teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game! It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong along  with being a good winner and loser.

Instead of just telling you what to do he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project which might not be the same.

This text by Arduser and Brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view.  It even comes with a companion CD-ROM that contains all forms from the book in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) and MS Word format. This is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired.The comprehensive 530+ page text covers everything I can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries. It is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the FDA Food Code. This excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read. The writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone.The seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics: Hazards to Food Safety; Factors Affecting Food-Born Illness; Food Safety Regulations; Following The Flow of Food; HACCP; and the Facility Plan. These are followed by an extremely helpful Glossary of terms. The Appendix includes all forms needed to meet the FDA requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment. Included are checklists signage compliance checklists and equipment cleaning charts allergen-control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel. There is even a Certificate of Completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests (included).With the rise in reports of food-borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times.  In my view this book is essential to ensure you are in total compliance.

Its a fascinating age in which Central Asian Buddhists North African nomads Ethiopian slaves Greek cave-dwellers Persian aristocrats Arab bureaucrats and a host of different cultures came together mixed wrote wonderful literature and lived the kind of drama that makes history fun. But its hard to find anything written about the time that isnt arcane professor babble or Islam 101. (You know There are five pillars of Islam... Snore.)Here Hugh Kennedy has written the book I always wanted. He wisely concentrates on medieval Islams golden age the early Abbasid dynasty when Baghdad ruled a large portion of the world-and even more astutely on the dramatic stories and personalities of the court. Lets face it you read about the Abbasids because you want to know how the slave girl Khayzuran not only managed to marry the caliph but to quell a military revolt why her son Harun al-Rashid was immortalized in The Arabian Nights and why the all-powerful Barmakid family suddenly fell from grace to prison and execution. Kennedy brings the caliphs and their families to life. Hes up front about the fact that the book is about aristocrats but the common people of Baghdad the pickpockets and sellers of cheap sweets who fought back when their city was besieged and the middle class who developed Islamic tradition dance around the edge of the narrative.Kennedy doesnt believe everything he reads and doesnt think you will either. He repeats stories-like the harem intrigue tales in which devious women are blamed for various deaths-that are almost certainly not true but tell us something about the people who believed them and are still enormously entertaining. He also is frank about the same-sex relationships male and female that were a part of the eras culture without the awkwardness of many modern historians. And hes smart enough to explain the geography-why,10.0,12.0,Hugh Kennedy,studied medieval islamic world little college fell love fascinating age which central asian buddhists north african nomads ethiopian slaves greek cavedwellers persian aristocrats arab bureaucrats host different cultures came together mixed wrote wonderful literature lived kind drama makes history fun hard find anything written about time isnt arcane professor babble or islam 101 know there five pillars islam snorehere hugh kennedy written book always wanted wisely concentrates medieval islams golden age early abbasid dynasty when baghdad ruled large portion worldand even more astutely dramatic stories personalities court lets face read about abbasids because want know how slave girl khayzuran not only managed marry caliph quell military revolt why her son harun alrashid immortalized arabian nights why allpowerful barmakid family suddenly fell grace prison execution kennedy brings caliphs families life hes up front about fact book about aristocrats common people baghdad pickpockets sellers cheap sweets who fought back when city besieged middle class who developed islamic tradition dance around edge narrativekennedy doesnt believe everything reads doesnt think either repeats storieslike harem intrigue tales which devious women blamed various deathsthat almost certainly not true tell us something about people who believed them still enormously entertaining also frank about samesex relationships male female part eras culture without awkwardness many modern historians hes smart enough explain geographywhy

The book is in three main sections: the physical setting (housing furnishings and clothing); the structure of the household (family connections including servants); and individual development (childhood coming of age and old age). The most striking thing is how all aspects of communal life were controlled by the Court: although laws were not draconian they spelled out how one was to conduct his or her life pretty thoroughly. Mess up and you would be punished. But its also true that people were not that different back then either: parents still cared for their children and worried about their futures by making provisions for them; families were at the core of societys welfare; even women were given rights denied them in the mother country. Its interesting that even these first settlers saw the American continent as a vast area just waiting to be colonized and one of the biggest problems facing the authorities was how to keep settlers from wanting to spread out too far from Plymouth itself thus weakening communal ties.

Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known. She knew of Gleb Botkins paintings before he even came to see her she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia (this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time) she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone. One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that. Aside from just her character there the many scars and lacerations on her body as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Andersons claim. For over six decades Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks. They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would. It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake. Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched. No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrews papers are still kept secret why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight burning of evidence.

Otherwise See Spot Run would be a masterpiece.  William Faulkner is a writer the likes of which we may never see again.  He is not only brilliant of word but of concept.

If you a person of average intelligence all you need is a character list and a careful reading and you will have absolutely no problem finding your way through the greatest novel ever written.  (Its an incredibly easy read the second time around.)  The Sound and the Fury is a summation of Faulkners works.  Everything that is done in the rest of his novels was first done in The Sound and the Fury.  The Sound and the Fury is poignant and tragic.  It is monumental in its mythical power.  It is Southern and yet it is universal.  It is Faulkners triumph as a novelist.  It is a study of human consciousness perception and existence.  The novel follows the decline and eventual fall of the Compson family.  In Faulkners world of Yoknapatawpha County the Compsons and Sartorises the Sutpens and de Spains in other words the established old families of Jefferson declined as the invasive and unethical Snopes portraits of the modern businessman ascended to power.  The story is an intimate portrayal of the Compsons and yet it is a symbolic and mythical account of decline and tragedy.  Why is it the greatest novel ever written?  It takes the innovations in narrative technique as developed by Joyce and Woolf in the movements of European Modernism (which it does better and with more purpose than Joyce and Woolf) and combines them with an exploration of storytelling and an intense devotion to a portrayal of place and region.  The story is great and moving.  The characters are loveable hateable tragic and intensely vivid.  The place is conceived and presented with taxing reality.  The language as with all of Faulkners novels is at times soaring and at times quite terse.  The structure is perfectly balanced and symbolically paired with the passion of Christ (the three days are Good Friday Holy Saturday and ,6.0,8.0,William Faulkner,reviewers above below warn novel difficult read if person average intelligence all need character list careful reading have absolutely no problem finding way through greatest novel ever written incredibly easy read second time around sound fury summation faulkners works everything done rest his novels first done sound fury sound fury poignant tragic monumental mythical power southern yet universal faulkners triumph novelist study human consciousness perception existence novel follows decline eventual fall compson family faulkners world yoknapatawpha county compsons sartorises sutpens de spains other words established old families jefferson declined invasive unethical snopes portraits modern businessman ascended power story intimate portrayal compsons yet symbolic mythical account decline tragedy why greatest novel ever written takes innovations narrative technique developed joyce woolf movements european modernism which does better more purpose than joyce woolf combines them exploration storytelling intense devotion portrayal place region story great moving characters loveable hateable tragic intensely vivid place conceived presented taxing reality language all faulkners novels times soaring times quite terse structure perfectly balanced symbolically paired passion christ three days good friday holy saturday

Barten,Saint Paul MN United States,People were looking for a book that could grab them about Nam when this was a best seller in 1972 and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days.  Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration.  Portions of this book originally appeared in `The New Yorker so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared.  Frances FitzGeralds original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966 and resulted in articles for the `Atlantic Monthly the `Village Voice `Vogue etc.  People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion.This book is not perfect.  The only listing for `Tonkin Gulf Resolution in the index is for the page on which President Johnsons use of the Resolution is questioned by Senator Fulbright in 1966.  That was the time this book is mainly concerned with but it gives an enormous amount of background information.  It is possible to find a listing in the index under ` GVN for `and U.S. entry into the war 354 which gives the page that reflects Secretary of Defense Robert McNamaras testimony to Congress that:It was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by GVN forces that North Vietnamese PT boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox,2.0,6.0,Frances FitzGerald,people looking book could grab them about nam when best seller 1972 book details people not getting television or front page newspapers days magazines published book reviews typically had view nam tuned more nuance individual points view than geopolitical justifications which failed consider nature situation nam itself primary consideration portions book originally appeared new yorker so author becoming widely known book being prepared frances fitzgeralds original trip vietnam february november 1966 resulted articles atlantic monthly village voice vogue etc people who read fashion magazines particularly interested what nice girl might think situation like nam where large numbers young americans being subjected military view situation personal level so intense most publications would refrain printing kind expressions which naturally describe emotional shock being shot or booby trapped some more surprising fashionthis book not perfect only listing tonkin gulf resolution index page which president johnsons use resolution questioned senator fulbright 1966 time book mainly concerned gives enormous amount background information possible find listing index under gvn us entry into war 354 which gives page reflects secretary defense robert mcnamaras testimony congress thatit response amphibious sabotage raid gvn forces north vietnamese pt boats attacked us destroyer maddox

Chicago and New York are the centers from which Katharine Kuh radiated. As a museum curator art dealer and published critic she was personally close to many of the modern masters. In this book she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives. I especially liked the chapters on Rothko Tobey and Noguchi.Disparate side characters such as Judge Learned Hand and LBJ pop up and add further to the value of Ms. Kuhs memoir. Avis Berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century American art by completing the memoirs of Katharine Kuh. The authors reflections have been preserved in a form while still true to the author that is likely better than had the elderly Ms. Kuh herself remained alive to complete the job.

However a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition. Classics do not only thrill and teach they also live. The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic. This tale of accusal love betrayal imprisonment redemption and retribution defies genre.  Recounting the plot serves no purpose so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. Here Dumas using Dantes Sinbad Albert and Abbe Busoni championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life. The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution an epic account of a mans quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption.

He arrived in Vietnam a year later and served as a foot soldier there for a year. Got wounded got traumatized the whole deal. Heres his account:At approximately 7:30 on the morning a company of roughly 115 American soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of My Lai. They met no resistance. No enemy. No incoming fire. Still for the next four hours Charlie Company killed whatever could be killed. They killed chickens. They killed dogs and cattle. They killed people too. Lots of people. Women infants teen-agers old men. The United States Armys Criminal Investigation Division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent Army inquiry led by Lieut. Gen. William R. Peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400. At the Son My Memorial a large tablet lists 504 names. According to Col.

Wright,books,4,A Solid Defense,September 8 2006,Challies Dot Com,Oakville Ontario,The Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame. It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith. Like its many predecessors it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus. A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly shot straight back down. Still while its popularity was short-lived it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ. Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered (The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century. It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi.National Geographic describes the importance of the document in this way: The Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus. Unlike the accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew Mark Luke and John in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor this newly discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus request when he hands Jesus over to the authorities. A classically dualistic gnostic document The Gospel of Judas presents a Jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks Judas to betray Him so He can be free of this wickedness. Judas complies and shows himself to be a hero rather than a villain. No longer the betrayer He is a faithful friend to Jesus Christ.Renowned New Testament scholar N.T. Wright is the first Christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of The Gospel of Judas. Judas and the Gospel of Jesus is due for publication in,27.0,39.0,N. T.

Although in fact it is not an easily readable book for the general public if you have a serious interest about the history of the third Reich make no mistake: you will not be able to overlook this book which will surely be a  classic. It is a thoroughly well researched  contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism; the interaction between the new domestic and international values based on aggression; and the other causes involved in the rise (and fall) of the III Reich. From a different perspective from other mainstream historians this winner of the Samuel Johnson prize for non fiction  has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular  period of history. No wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this  opus  -A new History- particularly well deserved.

Cloyce Smith rabid bookfiend,New York NY United States,Twains account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book part memoir and part historical work with a few sketches stories and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published Huckleberry Finn along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger full of comedy populated by a number of ornery mischievous and reckless characters and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when hes fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in Puddnhead Wilson if there was anything better in this world than steamboating it was the glory to be got by telling about it.After he published the series in the Atlantic Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so hed hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882 when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources unfortunately tends to bog things down--and there are,2.0,2.0,Mark Twain,twains account his years mississippi part travel book part memoir part historical work few sketches stories tall tales tossed good measure there even outtake notyetpublished huckleberry finn along extensive excerpts historical contemporary accounts other authors smorgasbord material makes uneven book much shows mark twain his humorous humanistic bestthe kernel volume best most cohesive section chapters 4 through 17 material appeared atlantic magazine 1875 recalls his early life crew member steamboats early 1850s his adventures young man fraught danger full comedy populated number ornery mischievous reckless characters occasionally embellished although twain bit obvious when hes fobbing off yarn twain later wrote puddnhead wilson if there anything better world than steamboating glory got telling about itafter published series atlantic twain added another 46 chapters much account his homecoming incognitoor so hed hoped mississippi river 1882 when steamboat had been rendered obsolete railroad many descriptions unusually twain melancholy remarks upon relatively emptiness river traffic notes transformations river banks had made steamboat travel safer less adventurous his new journey provides opportunities relate number storiessome allegedly told him river few unpublished tales deemed relevant worthy inclusionthe material other sources unfortunately tends bog things downand there

I explained that I had not yet started the book so I could not give an answer.

Myself a Carolina fan I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith whom I have admired for over forty years and the UNC basketball program which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. Dr. Bells contributions to the book tie Coach Smiths leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolinas storied history to todays business situations.  Surely Coach Smith given his ability to recruit top players has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA but winning two NCAA championships winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smiths &quot;system&quot;.

GaesserKarla Dougherty,books,5,The SPARK,May 6 2001,eojveb,Englewood CO USA,As an overweight stressed-out 40-something professional I am thrilled to find this book!  The SPARK is exactly what I needed to get my body moving again.  I am one of those who had fallen for the 1-hour a day exercise trap and if I didnt have an hour which I usually dont I just didnt exercise.  I love doing my three to four SPARKS a day knowing I am doing my body far more good than waiting for that elusive day when I can fit in 45 minutes or more for my workout.  This is a wonderful concept and so doable! Its working!! Thank you,23.0,23.0,Glenn A.

1923,0786113812:and_the_lesson_is...:fernando_berzal_galiano,786113812,Economics in One Lesson: Books: Henry HazlittJeff Riggenbach,books,5,And the lesson is...,July 9 2006,Fernando Berzal Galiano,Granada Spain,Always think twice. Never jump to hasty conclusions without considering ALL the effects of an act or decision. Thats the essence of Economics: looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy. Most economic fallacies are the result of ignoring this lesson as Henry Hazlitt clearly shows with many examples throughout this witty short book. Are there benefits in destruction (let it be a humble broken window or a bloody war? Is government spending the solution to unemployment or industries in trouble? Can taxes benefit the economy of a country? Do inflationary policies really encourage a well-functioning economy or are they just a smokescreen to conceal otherwise unpopular decisions? Are all labor union practices truly justified? And what about tariffs subsidies parity prices rent control or minimum wage laws? These are the kind of issues the author analyses beyond what you can usually hear read or see on the media.Beyond what you may think about the governments role in the economy whether you agree or not with the authors liberal views Economics in One Lesson shows how one should always try to see beyond the obvious and avoid missing the forest for the trees.As the author points out half-truths presented as complete truths are behind most economic fallacies. Demagogues and rogue economists try to divert our attention by focusing only on the most visible effects of a given decision (or in the worst cases on the only effects that should be seen not to discredit an already decided course of action). Learning to supplement and correct their half-truths with the other half is the most reasonable thing an independent thinker can do. BTW Economics in One Lesson might be a good place to start..,4.0,4.0,Henry HazlittJeff Riggenbach,always think twice never jump hasty conclusions without considering all effects act or decision thats essence economics looking not merely immediate longer effects any act or policy most economic fallacies result ignoring lesson henry hazlitt clearly shows many examples throughout witty short book there benefits destruction let humble broken window or bloody war government spending solution unemployment or industries trouble can taxes benefit economy country do inflationary policies really encourage wellfunctioning economy or just smokescreen conceal otherwise unpopular decisions all labor union practices truly justified what about tariffs subsidies parity prices rent control or minimum wage laws kind issues author analyses beyond what can usually hear read or see mediabeyond what may think about governments role economy whether agree or not authors liberal views economics one lesson shows how one should always try see beyond obvious avoid missing forest treesas author points out halftruths presented complete truths behind most economic fallacies demagogues rogue economists try divert our attention focusing only most visible effects given decision or worst cases only effects should seen not discredit already decided course action learning supplement correct halftruths other half most reasonable thing independent thinker can do btw economics one lesson might good place start

A Truett Wordy Girl,Mississippi,I found this in the church library but it is not Christian fiction. It is simply an easy read. The story is sweet made even sweeter by the topic. Cake. I am not even much of a cake person. I normally prefer ice cream or some sort of brownies/cookies etc... But as I read I found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator. I dont recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet. The need for sweets will be simply overpowering,,,Jeanne Ray,found church library not christian fiction simply easy read story sweet made even sweeter topic cake am not even much cake person normally prefer ice cream or some sort browniescookies etc read found myself longing bit intoxicating concoctions put together narrator dont recommend book if diabetic or diet need sweets simply overpowering

The mix of recipes is fine but they just seemed to be missing something. They were all more or less of the &quot;huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done&quot; variety. All of the recipes look tasty though I would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes especially some more creative ones. Lets be honest when you pay for a book youd like to see more than &quot;...put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated Dutch oven salt and pepper to taste cook until done.&quot; Give me a little something to work with here! Inspire me! I can already cook a roast like this in the oven. Having said all of that I would still reccommend this book. The vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and I cant wait to try some of them. As an aside this is the only Dutch oven book Ive seen with heart-healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare. Given that the average DO book requires the use of a metric ton of lard this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks,21.0,23.0,Jane Woodruff,overall book just fine someone interested cooking do mix recipes fine just seemed missing something all more or less quothuck good sized hen into pot cook while until donequot variety all recipes look tasty though would have liked have seen few more meat dishes especially some more creative ones lets honest when pay book youd like see more than quotput 5 lb beef roast into preheated dutch oven salt pepper taste cook until donequot give little something work here inspire can already cook roast like oven having said all would still reccommend book vegetable dishes desserts look fantastic cant wait try some them aside only dutch oven book ive seen hearthealthy recipes well more traditional fare given average do book requires use metric ton lard probably appeal wider range cooks

Crutcher,Louisville KY USA,John Gunthers INSIDE U.S.A. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get hurling us back to the America of 1947 as he explores state by state the people politics issues passions and fads that make up our country.  Written with great energy and insight Gunther captures an America justly proud of its WWII success still unsure of its role in the world and populated by fascinating characters like Mayor LaGuardia of New York Governor Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Boss Hague of Jersey City.  Gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today.  He captures aspects of America that are gonel never to return (an &quot;industrial&quot; nation based on coal iron ore and steel.)  And he foresees issues that dog America to this day -- the &quot;Negro problem&quot; (actually the &quot;White problem.&quot;)  He condemns the segregationist society he finds in America so inconsistent with its lofty ideals.  As you can tell I loved this book.  Its very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down Gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading.  All this said Gunther does concentrate on the (a) historical (b) political and (c) economic side of things.  You wont find much here about the arts or science.  But it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly,4.0,4.0,John Gunther,john gunthers inside usa comes close time travel likely get hurling us back america 1947 explores state state people politics issues passions fads make up our country written great energy insight gunther captures america justly proud wwii success still unsure role world populated fascinating characters like mayor laguardia new york governor saltonstall massachusetts boss hague jersey city gunther describes regional characteristics persist today captures aspects america gonel never return quotindustrialquot nation based coal iron ore steel foresees issues dog america day quotnegro problemquot actually quotwhite problemquot condemns segregationist society finds america so inconsistent lofty ideals can tell loved book very hefty every time about put down gunther comes up another amazing fact or interesting sidelight keeps reading all said gunther does concentrate historical b political c economic side things wont find much here about arts or science amazing single individual could have compiled much data presented so interestingly
